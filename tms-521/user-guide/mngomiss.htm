<h2 class="sect1">Classification Concepts</h2>
<p>The process of assigning a source term&mdash;a term collected during a clinical trial as a response to a CRF question&mdash;to a dictionary term is called <span class="italic">classifying</span> the term. After loading a group of source terms, you run the Autoclassification process, which classifies as many terms as possible automatically:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If a dictionary term exists that is exactly the same as the source term and is unique in the coding level, the process classifies the source term to the dictionary term, creating a <span class="italic">Verbatim Term Assignment</span> (<span class="bold">VTA</span>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a dictionary term exists that is exactly the same as the source term and is NOT unique in the coding level but has auxiliary information, the process can classify the source term with the same auxiliary information to the dictionary term, creating a <span class="italic">Verbatim Term Individual</span> (<span class="bold">VTI</span>); see <a href="defdict.htm#CHDCHECF">"Nonunique Coding Level Dictionaries"</a> for more information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If an existing VTA&mdash;either automatically or manually created&mdash;matches the source term, the process classifies the source term to the VTA.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If an existing VTI&mdash;either automatically or manually created&mdash; matches the source term and its auxiliary information, the process classifies the source term to the VTI.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If Autoclassification cannot classify a term, it creates an <span class="italic">omission</span>. A user must classify each omission, manually creating a VTA or VTI. Autoclassification then classifies each subsequent occurrence of the same source term to the manually created VTA or VTI.</p>
<p>A user can classify an omission to an existing VTA, but not to an existing VTI. When a user classifies a term to an existing VTA, behind the scenes TMS maps the verbatim term directly to the dictionary term specified by the VTA.</p>
<p>See <a href="admin.htm#BABHJBGD">"Autoclassification"</a> for more information.</p>
<p><a id="BEICEIFE"></a><a id="TMSUG11720"></a><span class="subhead3">Misspelled VTAs and VTIs&nbsp;</span>It is possible to designate a VTA or VTI as misspelled, and a dictionary term can have any number of misspelled VTAs and VTIs; for example, the dictionary term acetyl salicylic acid might have misspelled VTAs asperin and aspurin as well as (not misspelled) aspirin. When you classify a term, you must select either Misspelled or Accepted (not misspelled).</p>
<p><a id="TMSUG11721"></a><span class="subhead3">Approved and Unapproved VTAs&nbsp;</span>In each dictionary/domain you specify whether you want VTAs to be created as Approved or Unapproved. Unapproved VTAs require explicit manual approval for each occurrence.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If VTAs are created as Approved, no further action is required. Autoclassification maps all occurrences of the term to the Approved VTA. However, it is possible to declassify or reclassify a verbatim term.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If VTAs are created as Unapproved, all occurrences of the term are mapped to the Unapproved VTA until a user explicitly approves the VTA. All subsequent occurrences are mapped to the Approved VTA.</p>
<div class="infobox-note">
<p class="notep1">Note:</p>
VTIs&mdash;Verbatim Term Individuals, classifications to a nonunique dictionary term&mdash;are always created as Approved.</div>
</li>
</ul>
<p><a id="TMSUG11722"></a><span class="subhead3">Global and Domain VTAs&nbsp;</span>A <a href="glossary.htm#CBACAIAB"><span class="xrefglossterm">Domain VTA</span></a> is available for use in classification only in the TMS domain in which it was created. A <a href="glossary.htm#CBACCJBD"><span class="xrefglossterm">Global VTA</span></a> is available across all TMS domains. Domain VTAs take precedence over Global VTAs: if a domain version of a VTA exists in the current TMS domain, you will see only it, even if a global version also exists.</p>
<p>You can <span class="italic">promote</span> a Domain VTA to be a Global VTA or <span class="italic">demote</span> a Global VTA to a Domain VTA in the Promote/Demote VTAs window.</p>
<p><a id="TMSUG11723"></a><span class="subhead3">Classification and Verbatim Term Levels&nbsp;</span>You can classify omissions to terms in either the classification level of the dictionary, which are dictionary terms, or to terms in the Verbatim Term level, which are previously classified terms (VTAs). If you select a VTA, behind the scenes TMS instead classifies the verbatim term directly to the dictionary term to which the VTA you selected is classified.</p>
<p><a id="BEIBJJIC"></a><a id="TMSUG11724"></a><span class="subhead3">Candidate Terms and Search Objects&nbsp;</span>Your company may set up Search Objects, or algorithms, to supplement the basic Autoclassification process to find possible valid dictionary matches in an automated way. These are presented as <span class="italic">candidate</span> terms.</p>
<p>Search Objects are executed in order and run only until candidate terms are found, and the Search Object that found them is displayed in the <span class="bold">Search</span> field. You can run Search Objects during manual classification. Unless there have been changes to the database since Autoclassification, you will not find any candidate terms by using a search object whose execution order is lower than the one entered in the <span class="bold">Search</span> field. However, you may find additional matches by using a search object with a higher execution order. You can see the order of execution in the Define Search Objects window under the Definition menu.</p>
<p><a id="TMSUG11725"></a><span class="subhead3">Actions&nbsp;</span>Sometimes you cannot manually classify a term because the term itself is flawed. For example, a term might include two symptoms that cannot be mapped to a single dictionary term, such as <span class="italic">headache and nausea</span>. Or a term may be garbled because a data entry operator's fingers were on the wrong keyboard keys; for example <span class="italic">sd[otom</span> instead of <span class="italic">aspirin</span>. In this case, you can assign a predefined Action to the term and send it back to the external source data system. Actions contain a message; for example, <span class="italic">Please split the term</span> or <span class="italic">Please clarify</span>. See <a href="defmisc.htm#i1001382">"Defining and Using Actions"</a>.</p>
<p><a id="BEIHAJAI"></a><a id="TMSUG11726"></a><span class="subhead3">Internal Actions for Unapproved Actions&nbsp;</span>To minimize the time spent on communication with the external system, you can require that Action assignments be approved before being sent back to the source system. In this case, you allocate an <span class="italic">Internal Action</span> as a task to a TMS user to approve an external Action before sending it to the source data system. See <a href="defmisc.htm#i1001382">"Defining and Using Actions"</a>.</p>
<p><a id="TMSUG11727"></a><span class="subhead3">Discrepancy Message&nbsp;</span>You can send a message to the external system regarding a single source term in the Classify VT Omissions window. A discrepancy message is not predefined; you enter text specifically for a particular source term. See <a href="#BEIDFIIJ">"Applying a Discrepancy Message"</a>.</p>
<p><a id="TMSUG11728"></a><span class="subhead3">Activities&nbsp;</span>Your organization can assign tasks, including classifying omissions and approving unapproved VTAs and actions, to you and other users. You can create lists of the tasks assigned to you and use them to organize your daily work; see <a href="#BJFJHAFH">"Creating and Using Activity Lists"</a>.</p>
<p><a id="TMSUG11729"></a><span class="subhead3">Term Statuses&nbsp;</span>TMS automatically assigns statuses to terms&mdash;omissions and unapproved VTAs&mdash;as they go from one stage to the next and become approved VTAs or VTIs. These statuses reflect whether or not they are allocated to a user and whether or not an Action is associated with them. Most statuses have substatuses. See <a href="#BEIGEFBG">"Term Statuses"</a> for more information.</p>

<div id="TMSUG11730" class="sect1"><!-- infolevel="all" infotype="General" -->
<h2 class="sect1">Classifying Terms Manually<a id="sthref468"></a></h2>
<p>You resolve omissions&mdash;terms that TMS could not classify automatically&mdash;by manually classifying<a id="sthref469"></a> the term. The type of classification you can create, and the system's behavior after your classification, depend on how the dictionary is set up by your organization.</p>
<p><a id="TMSUG11731"></a><span class="subhead3">VTA&nbsp;</span>If the dictionary allows only unique dictionary terms in the classification level, you classify an omission by creating a Verbatim Term Assignment (<a href="glossary.htm#CBAJCIEA"><span class="xrefglossterm">VTA</span></a>). TMS automatically classifies all future occurrences of the same term to the same VTA. VTAs can be created as global or domain-specific, approved or not approved, misspelled or accepted.</p>
<p><a id="TMSUG11732"></a><span class="subhead3">VTI<a id="sthref470"></a> with Auxiliary Information&nbsp;</span>If the dictionary allows nonunique classification-level terms and includes auxiliary information for dictionary terms, like WHO-Drug Format C, you classify an omission by creating a Verbatim Term Individual (<a href="glossary.htm#CBACHDAF"><span class="xrefglossterm">VTI</span></a>). TMS automatically classifies all future occurrences of the same term with the same auxiliary information to the same VTI. VTIs are always approved and domain-specific. They can be misspelled or accepted.</p>
<p><a id="TMSUG11733"></a><span class="subhead3">VTI<a id="sthref471"></a> without Auxiliary Information&nbsp;</span>If the dictionary allows nonunique classification-level terms but has no auxiliary information&mdash;which is possible for MedDRA if nonunique dictionary terms are related to different higher-level dictionary terms&mdash;you classify an omission by creating a Verbatim Term Individual (<a href="glossary.htm#CBACHDAF"><span class="xrefglossterm">VTI</span></a>) in the All Verbatim Term Omissions tab. The classification applies only to the occurrence you code.</p>
<p><a id="TMSUG11734"></a><span class="subhead3">Actions&nbsp;</span>If you cannot classify a term because the term itself is flawed, you can request that it be corrected by using an <a href="glossary.htm#CBAHIAGH"><span class="xrefglossterm">action</span></a>.</p>

<h3 class="sect2">Classify a Term</h3>
<p>To classify a term:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In the upper block, select the verbatim term to classify. In the Classifications tab, select the dictionary term or VTA to which you want to classify it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <span class="bold">Global?</span> box is selected or deselected by default according to settings elsewhere in TMS. You can override the default for a particular VTA:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Select the <span class="bold">Global?</span> box to make the VTA available in all domains where a Domain VTA for the same term does not exist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deselect the <span class="bold">Global?</span> box to make the VTA available only in the current domain.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the verbatim term is spelled correctly, select <span class="bold">Accepted</span> from the <span class="bold">VTA/VTI Subtype</span> list. If not, select <span class="bold">Misspelled</span>. Future occurrences that are misspelled the same way will be classified the same way. Specifying whether the verbatim term is spelled correctly when you classify provides more accurate records.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enter a <span class="bold">Comment</span> indicating why you chose this term for the classification.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click <span class="bold">Classify VT</span> or <span class="bold">Create VTI</span> (available only when using the All... tab above). TMS enters the repository term to which you have linked the verbatim term in the <span class="bold">Dictionary Term</span> field in the upper block.</p>
<div class="infobox-note">
<p class="notep1">Note:</p>
If you make a mistake during manual classification or a dictionary term is added that is a better match for a classified verbatim term, you can reclassify the term (see <a href="vtamaint.htm#i1002007">"Reclassifying and Declassifying Verbatim Terms"</a>).</div>

<h3 class="sect2"><a id="BEIGJJGC"></a>Apply an Action to a Term<a id="sthref474"></a><a id="sthref475"></a></h3>
<p>If you cannot classify a term, it may be appropriate to assign an Action to it instead. Use actions in the following situations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If the verbatim term is flawed, assign an Action to the term requesting that the term be fixed. TMS sends the Action text back to the external source system. In Oracle Clinical, the next Batch Validation creates a discrepancy for the question response with the Action text as the comment and the TMS user (you) as the creator of the comment. See <a href="defmisc.htm#CHDCGDHH">"Answerable Actions"</a> for more information.</p>
<p>Approval of Answerable Action assignments may be required for particular dictionary domain; see <a href="#BEIDGAEH">"Approving Action Assignments"</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may need to send a message to the external system that does not require a response, or you may not have the resources to support a dialog. See <a href="defmisc.htm#CHDGGJHE">"Unaswerable Actions"</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you need to speak to your supervisor or do research before you can classify a term, you can assign an Action to the term that says you are working on it. When other coders see the Action text, they will know not to duplicate your efforts. See <a href="defmisc.htm#CHDEACAF">"Internal Actions"</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You must select an Action that has already been defined (see <a href="defmisc.htm#i1001382">"Defining and Using Actions"</a>). Actions apply to all occurrences of the same verbatim term omission (VTO) in the same dictionary/domain combination.</p>
<p>To send a message to the external system about a single occurrence of a verbatim term, you can use a discrepancy message. See <a href="#BEIDFIIJ">"Applying a Discrepancy Message"</a> for instructions.</p>

<p>To apply an Action to a verbatim term:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In the top block of the Classify VT Omissions window, query for the verbatim term to which you want to apply an Action. Select the term.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the bottom block, click the <span class="bold">Distinct VTO Actions</span> tab to open it.</p>
</li>
<li>

TMS displays the Action type and the default Action text in the corresponding fields to the right; see <a href="defmisc.htm#CHDJFEJG">"Action Types"</a>. You can modify the Action text if necessary.</p>
<p>TMS displays only actions that are valid options for the current user. TMS displays only Internal Actions and Unanswerable Actions to users without the Approve or Reclassify privilege or the overriding profile setting. Users with the Approve privilege, or Reclassify privilege, or overriding profile setting can see all active actions in the drop-down.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click <span class="bold">Apply Action</span>. TMS assigns the Action to the term and lists the Action in the lower part of the tab. The action applies to all occurrences of the verbatim term.</p>
<div class="infobox-note">
<p class="notep1">Note:</p>
If you are working in a dictionary with nonunique terms in the classification level, the system does not apply the action to occurrences of the verbatim term that have been classified to a VTI.

<h2 class="sect1">Approving and Unapproving VTAs</h2>
<p>If a verbatim term assignment (VTA) is approved, the classification is immediately available for derivation and Autoclassification. Once a VTA is approved, no new occurrences of the same verbatim term show up as omissions.</p>
<p>If a VTA is not approved, the user must manually classify each new occurrence of the verbatim term, but TMS proposes the unapproved VTA's dictionary term as the only Candidate Term. The user must either accept the Candidate Term or reclassify the verbatim term (see <a href="vtamaint.htm#i1001979">"Global and Domain VTAs"</a>). Working with Nonapproved VTAs gives you an opportunity to review classifications that TMS would otherwise create automatically, may give you a better feel for the data and help you catch mistakes.</p>
<p>You can approve Nonapproved VTAs when you are satisfied that the classification is correct and no longer want to approve each occurrence of the verbatim term (see <a href="admin.htm#BABHJBGD">"Autoclassification"</a>). You can also undo a VTA's approval to change the assignment of new occurrences of a verbatim term.</p>
<p>The reference codelist TMS_CONFIGURATION contains a setting that determines whether Nonapproved VTAs are or are not be used for derivation to the external system. If Nonapproved VTAs are derived, the external system sees no difference between derivations based on approved and Nonapproved VTAs.</p>
<p>For details on creating VTAs, promoting them to global status or demoting them to domain-specific status, see <a href="vtamaint.htm#BABEBGBH">Chapter 11, "VTA and VTI Maintenance."</a></p>

<h3 class="sect2">Understanding the Approve VTAs Window</h3>
<p>You start to change the approval status of a VTA by querying for it in the upper part of the Approve VTAs window. There are two blocks in this part of the window:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <span class="bold">Distinct Verbatim Term Assignments</span> block shows the unique verbatim terms from this database that have been to terms in the selected dictionary. This block also displays information about the dictionary term to which this verbatim term is currently mapped.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By contrast, the <span class="bold">All Verbatim Term Assignments</span> block shows verbatim term information for each instance of each verbatim term introduced to TMS by the selected database, and provides information from the external system about these verbatim terms.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For each VTA they describe, the <span class="bold">Distinct</span> and <span class="bold">All Verbatim Term Assignments</span> blocks display the following information about a VTA.</p>
<p><a id="TMSUG11752"></a><span class="subhead3">Appr?&nbsp;</span>If selected, the VTA is approved for use in Autoclassification and manual classification. If not selected, TMS proposes the VTA as a Candidate Term but manual approval is required for each occurrence.</p>
<p><a id="TMSUG11753"></a><span class="subhead3">Glb?&nbsp;</span>(Global?) If selected, the VTA is available in all domains.</p>
<p><a id="TMSUG11754"></a><span class="subhead3">Subtype&nbsp;</span>The VTA is either <span class="bold">Misspelled</span> or <span class="bold">Accepted</span> (correctly spelled).</p>

<p><a id="TMSUG11756"></a><span class="subhead3">Dictionary Term&nbsp;</span>(Distinct block only) By default, this field shows the dictionary term to which the verbatim term is assigned, if any.</p>
<p>The remaining blocks on the <span class="bold">Distinct Verbatim Term Assignments</span> block provide read-only information about the term displayed in the <span class="bold">Dictionary Term</span> field. For details on any of these fields, see <a href="dictmnt.htm#i1006994">"Current Level and Term"</a>.</p>
<p><a id="TMSUG11757"></a><span class="subhead3">Value 1 - 8 Fields&nbsp;</span>(All VTA blocks only) When an external system is fully integrated with TMS, the Approve VTAs window displays column information for verbatim terms originating in that external system. You define these columns in the Define External Systems window as the <span class="bold">Value 1</span> through <span class="bold">Value 8</span> fields for that external system. In addition, when you define detail information for a column, TMS displays the text in the field corresponding to the column in blue. The user can then use the drill-down function to see detail information. See <a href="integ.htm#CHDFBBED">"Defining External System Information in TMS"</a>.</p>
<p><a id="TMSUG11758"></a><span class="subhead3">Filter&nbsp;</span>Click the Filter button to change the filter settings to refine query results from this window.

<p><a id="TMSUG11759"></a><span class="subhead3">Above Current VTA&nbsp;</span>The system displays dictionary terms related to the current term in the levels above the current term. The tree is displayed upside-down: the VTA is displayed at the top, with the related terms in the next higher level displayed just below it, and the related terms in higher levels below those terms.</p>
<p><a id="TMSUG11760"></a><span class="subhead3">Declassify&nbsp;</span>To declassify a VTA rather than approve it, select the nonapproved VTA and click <span class="bold">Declassify</span>; see <a href="#BEICCFCB">"Declassifying a VTA"</a> for more information.</p>
<div class="infobox-note">

<h3 class="sect2">Declassifying a VTA</h3>
<p>If you do not want to approve a nonapproved VTA, you can declassify it in the Approve VTAs window. The term becomes an omission and can be classified to a different dictionary term in the Classify VT Omissions window.</p>
<p>You can add an Action to a term as you declassify it. If the term itself is flawed and you need more information from the source system where the term was collected, you can assign an answerable external Action to the term and send its text to the external system; see <a href="#BABFGBCJ">"Apply an Action to a Term"</a> for information about actions.</p>
<p>To declassify a term without assigning an Action to the term, click <span class="bold">Declassify</span> or select <span class="bold">Declassify</span> from the <span class="bold">Options</span> menu.</p>

<p>For each dictionary/domain combination you can configure TMS to send omissions with actions applied directly to the external system or to pass through an approval stage. The approval stage allows an intermediate individual to decide if it is really necessary to take the extra time for the term to travel through the additional processing cycle. See <a href="defdict.htm#i1009237">"Creating Domains and Assigning Dictionaries to Domains"</a> for more information.</p>
<p>Users must have TMS_APPROVE_PRIV to approve Internal Action assignments. Users with TMS_CLASSIFY_PRIV can query in the Approve Action Assignments window, but cannot perform any operations there.</p>

<div id="TMSUG11772" class="sect3"><!-- infolevel="all" infotype="General" -->
<h4 class="sect3">Distinct and All Action Assignments</h4>
<p>In the tabs in the upper part of the Approve Action Assignments window, TMS displays only the current Action assignments. To see a history of the term's Action assignments, use the tabs in the lower part of the window.</p>
<p>There are two tabs in the upper part of the window:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <span class="bold">Distinct Action Assignments</span> tab shows Action assignments associated with unique verbatim terms.</p>
<p>You can approve actions only in the Distinct Action Assignment window. TMS then applies the Action assignment to all occurrences of the same term.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By contrast, the <span class="bold">All Action Assignments</span> tab shows all occurrences of the verbatim term that is selected in the <span class="bold">Distinct Action Assignments</span> tab, and provides external system info for each source term.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To see data, enter a query in the <span class="bold">Distinct Action Assignments</span> tab. Select a radio button to restrict the query as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">All</span> allows queries to retrieve both internal and Answerable Action assignments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Approved</span> allows queries to retrieve only Answerable Action assignments that have been approved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Not approved</span> allows queries to retrieve only Internal Action assignments, including those with and without base Answerable Actions. However, only those with base Answerable Actions can be approved.</p>
<div class="infobox-note">
<p class="notep1">Note:</p>
Internal Actions defined with a base Answerable Action are used as an approval mechanism. When you query for nonapproved actions, you retrieve only Internal Actions (some of which may not have base Answerable Actions and therefore not require or support approval). When you approve one of these Internal Action assignments, TMS immediately assigns the base Answerable Action to the term in place of the Internal Action. Therefore, when you query for approved Action assignments, you retrieve only Answerable Actions.</div>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="infobox-note">
<p class="notep1">Note:</p>
TMS does not display unAnswerable Action assignments in this window.</div>
<p>Query results are also filtered by the settings in the Filter window. To check and change your filter settings, click the <span class="bold">Filter</span> button. See <a href="#BJFCJGBB">"Setting Filters and Creating Activity Lists"</a> for more information.</p>
<p>For each term, TMS displays the following information. Some information is displayed only on the Distinct tab or only on the All tab (as noted):</p>
<p><a id="TMSUG11773"></a><span class="subhead3">N&nbsp;</span>(<span class="bold">Distinct</span> tab only.) If an N appears to the left of the Appr? field, the term has at least one note associated with it. Go to <span class="bold">Status/Notes</span> to see the term's notes.</p>

<p>However, the notes do not necessarily have any relation to the status displayed next to them. Notes and statuses are both displayed in chronological order, but because you can create a note without changing the status, and can change the status without creating a note, status changes and notes that correspond logically may not be displayed next to each other.</p>

<p>In the VT History window you can see the status history of any term, whether it is currently an omission, a verbatim term with an Action, a VTA, or a VTI. This is the only window in TMS where you can see the status history of terms with any current status and create notes for any term.</p>
<p>To view the current status and substatus of any term as well as to view the complete status history of any term and add a label or note associated with a status change, do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In the Omission Management menu, select VT History. The VT History window opens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Query for the term whose history you want to see, or query for a particular status to see all terms at that status. See <a href="overview.htm#CHDDBFHF">"Querying in Windows"</a>. The system displays the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Term</span>. The term name.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Domain Name</span>. The domain in which the term applies, or Global if it applies in all domains. If the term is valid in more than one domain, whether it is not is not also global, it is listed multiple times, once for each domain/dictionary combination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Dictionary Name</span>. The dictionary to which the term is mapped. If a term is mapped to multiple dictionaries, it is listed multiple times, once for each domain/dictionary combination.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Status</span>/<span class="bold">Substatus</span>. The term's current status and substatus in the domain/dictionary combination on the same row; see <a href="#BEIGEFBG">"Term Statuses"</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Assigned</span>. If a task associated with the term&mdash;classifying the VTO, approving an Action assignment or unapproved VTA&mdash;is currently assigned to a user, the person's user name appears in this column.</p>

<h3 class="sect2">Using Activity Lists</h3>
<p>You can use the Activity List window in the Omission Management menu as your starting point for work every day. You can set up your activity list to organize the tasks allocated to you (if your company is using task allocation) and keep track of the tasks you have not yet done. Each activity lists a single type of task&mdash;omissions to be classified, unapproved VTAs or Action assignments to be approved&mdash;in a particular domain/dictionary combination or in all domains and/or all dictionaries.</p>
<p>You can click the activity name to see and work on the individual tasks allocated to you in the appropriate window: Classify Omissions, Approve VTAs, or Approve Action Assignments. When you close the window you return to the Activity List window and you can proceed to a different activity.</p>
<p>To create an activity, enter criteria in the filter pop-up window in the Classify Omissions, Approve VTAs, or Approve Action Assignments and save the filter as an activity (see <a href="#BJFCJGBB">"Setting Filters and Creating Activity Lists"</a>).</p>
<p>The Activity List window always displays a summary of the current results of the filter, including the task type, dictionary, domain, term status, and current total.</p>
<p>You can also create activity lists of other users' tasks, though you will only be able to see terms to which you have standard Data Access Group security access.</p>

<div id="TMSUG11834" class="sect3">
<h4 class="sect3"><a id="sthref500"></a><a id="sthref501"></a>Setting Filters</h4>
<p>The values you set here limit the results retrieved by queries in the window. For example, if you specify a dictionary, TMS displays only terms in that dictionary.</p>
<p>Your default filter criteria settings are determined by your TMS user profile. Any changes you make to the filter settings continue in effect throughout your current session, even if you change windows, until you change the setting again. If your user profile does not set defaults, and you have not selected any during your TMS session, the Filter window opens automatically when you launch any of these windows.</p>
<p>To set filter criteria, do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Choose <span class="bold">Options</span>, then <span class="bold">Filter</span>, or click the <span class="bold">Filter</span> button. The Filter pop-up window opens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select a dictionary and domain to work in:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Domain</span>. Select a value from the drop-down list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Dictionary</span>. Select a value from the drop-down list.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>To narrow the search, select values for one or more of the following fields:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Assigned</span>. To see your own assignments, enter your user name or [LOGIN_USER] (the default value). You can enter other people's user names or leave the field blank to see assignments to all users, but the results will be limited to the terms to which you have security access through a Data Access Group.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">TMS DB</span>. Select the database. There may be only one option.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Status</span>. Select a status.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For omissions, the valid statuses are: VTO and Allocated VTO.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For VTAs, the valid statuses are: Unapproved VTA and Allocated VTA.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For actions, the valid statuses are: Internal Action and Allocated Action.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Only certain statuses make sense in the context of a particular window. If you select a status that does not apply in context, the system ignores the status value altogether and returns results based on the other criteria.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Substatus</span>. You can select a substatus only if you first select a status.</p>
<div class="infobox-note">
<p class="notep1">Note:</p>
The system does not limit the selection of substatuses to the substatuses appropriate to the status you selected. If you select a substatus that is invalid for the status, the query does not retrieve any records. For a list of statuses and their substatuses, see <a href="#BEIGEFBG">"Term Statuses"</a>.</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>To specify external system criteria for the filter, click the <span class="bold">External System</span> tab and enter values for one or more of the fields:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">External System</span>. Select an external source data system from the list of values, or select All Systems.</p>
<p>When you select an external system, TMS refreshes the screen to display the information stored for each source term in TMS; for example, for Oracle Clinical TMS displays Study, Patient, Document Number, and five other values.</p>
<div class="infobox-note">
<p class="notep1">Note:</p>
If you have created a VTA proactively using the Repository Maintenance or Repository Authoring window, but a corresponding source term has never entered TMS from an external system, TMS displays the VTA only if you select All Systems.</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Source Database</span>. If the external system feeds data from multiple databases into TMS, you can specify a single one if you wish.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">External System-Specific Information</span>. TMS displays up to eight (8) additional fields custom-defined for the external system you specified.</p>
<div class="infobox-note">
<p class="notep1">Note:</p>
If you selected All Systems in the External System field, Values 1&hellip;8 contain all values for all systems. For example, if you are using TMS with both Oracle Clinical and AERS, and Value 3 is defined as Patient for Oracle Clinical and Case for AERS, the list of values in the Value 3 column includes both OC Patients and AERS Cases.</div>

<li>
<p>When you call the Filter window from Classify VT Omissions or Approve Action Assignments (but not Approve VTAs) there is a third filter tab called <span class="bold">Actions</span>. You can enter values as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Action Workflow</span>. You can choose to retrieve only one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Rerouted Actions only</span>. Terms with actions assigned that have returned to TMS from an external system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Actions not owned by TMS</span>. Terms with actions assigned currently owned by the external source data system; no Action can be taken within TMS on the terms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">No Open Actions</span>. Terms without an Action currently assigned.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Any Open Actions</span>. Terms with an Action currently assigned.</p>
</li>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
