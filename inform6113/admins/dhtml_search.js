Indicates whether to create a query when, during communication with the Central Coding application, data is found to be entered into a data item by the two different servers.","4","Number of execution plan listener threads","Number of threads running in the background to process pending execution plans. The default is 4; at least 1 is required for any execution plans to run.","5","Number of Workflow Update threads","Number of threads running in the background to process the workflow update. This value is set during study setup, and typically only needs to be set one time per study. The default value is 2.","Caution: You should not adjust this setting without input from Oracle Global Support. If the performance of your study deployment or study migration is too slow (for example, timeouts happen), contact Oracle Global Support for assistance.","5","Number of execution plan re-submits","Maximum number of times to retry submission of a failed execution plan before it is logged as an error in the event log and removed from the queue of execution plans to be run.

The default is 350 characters.","9","Require unique subject initials and date of birth","Study, Site, or None (default).

","Subject record transfer consideration: If you plan to allow the transfer of subjects from one site to another, set the UniqueIntIDOBSwitch attribute to require unique initials and DOB across the study. This prevents the following situation: ","If a study does not require unique initials and date of birth, or only requires site uniqueness, and a user transfers a subject to a site where another subject exists who has the same initials and date of birth, the subject transfer fails.","To transfer the subject, the user must change the subject initials to make the combination unique.","10","Require unique subject ID","Study (default), Site, or None. Indicates whether the InForm application requires a unique subject number for a study, a site, or not at all.","Note: If you specify that a unique subject number is not required and subjects with identical numbers are entered, and later you specify that unique subject numbers are required, the duplicate information that was previously entered will not be reported.","Subject record transfer consideration: If you plan to allow the transfer of a subject from one site to another, set this option to require subject numbers to be unique across the entire study. The InForm application does not allow a subject to be transferred to another site in which a subject exists with the same subject number. If a conflict arises, the InForm application rejects the transfer, and you must manually change the subject number of the transferring subject to a value that is not duplicated at the target site.","Partial SV consideration: If you plan to use partial source verification, set this option to Study or Site.","11","Allow sponsor users to edit frozen forms","Yes or No (default). Indicates whether sponsors will be able to edit a CRF after it has been marked as frozen.","Batch run calculation rule consideration: If you plan to run calculation batch rules on case report books that are unfrozen and unlocked, but that have individually frozen forms, set this option to Yes to prevent errors.","12","Order of UserName in Signature","Order of the names in the signature.","FirstName,LastName (default)","LastName,FirstName","13","Visit Calculator ","Enabled or Disabled (default).
