<h2 class="sect1"><span class="secnum">2.1</span> Overview</h2>
<p>Oracle Argus Analytics includes dashboards, reports, and metrics that let you view relevant, interactive information&mdash;current as at the last date the data mart was refreshed. It also includes dashboards and reports to access the run-time data.</p>
<p><span class="italic">Dashboards</span> are access points for information. Each dashboard is designed for a specific job responsibility.</p>
<p>When you access a dashboard, the information displayed changes based on your security privileges. For example, a user with BIConsumer application role may not be able to see the same data as the user with BIAuthor role.</p>
<p>A dashboard contains one or more related dashboard <span class="italic">pages</span>. A dashboard page contains a series of related <span class="italic">reports</span> (also called <span class="italic">requests</span>). A report can contain a tabular report, pivot table, or graph. You can drill down to detailed report by clicking the linked data. You can also filter the data that you see in reports using a set of <span class="italic">parameters</span> (called <span class="italic">filters</span>). Figure 2-1 displays the report hierarchy.</p>

<br /></div>
<!-- class="figure" -->
<p>In addition to the dashboards and reports that are packaged with Oracle Argus Analytics, you can also create and manage reports or dashboards if you have appropriate permissions. Use Oracle BI Analysis to manage reports.</p>
<p>OBIEE includes additional applications that are not directly used by Oracle Argus Analytics. These include Oracle BI Agents and Oracle BI Publisher. These applications extend the usefulness of the information provided by Oracle Argus Analytics.</p>
<p>Use Oracle BI Agents to detect specific analytic results and notify appropriate user or group about the result. Use Oracle BI Publisher to create formatted and printable reports.</p>

<p>Perform the following steps to view a dashboard:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Log in to Oracle Argus Analytics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click the Dashboard drop-down menu and select the relevant dashboard.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="infobox-note">
<p class="notep1">Note:</p>
You might get the following errors while accessing reports if there is no data in Argus Safety:
<p><span class="italic">Error Codes: OPR4ONWY:U9IM8TAC:OI2DL65P</span></p>
<p><span class="italic">State: HY000. Code: 10058. [NQODBC] [SQL_STATE: HY000] [nQSError: 10058] A general error has occurred. [nQSError: 43113] Message returned from OBIS</span>.</p>
<p>[<span class="italic">nQSError: 23006] The session variable, NQ_SESSION.USER_LN, has no value definition. (HY000)</span></p>
<p>Conditions that will produce this error:</p>
<p>1. The connection pool in the RPD is not set to the correct credentials to point to the RPD schema that was created during the install. a. To verify this we can open the RPD in online mode via the BI Administration Tool and check the DB connection details in the RPD, Physical Layer -&gt; OPVA_DWH -&gt; OPVA_CP and OPVA_CP_Initblocks connection pools.</p>
<p>2. The PVA row level security is inherited from the Argus Safety Instance that it is linked to. The user names that one creates in OBIEE (if using the built-in LDAP of WLS or external LDAP) should be the same as that in the Argus Safety system. For example, if 'admin' is the login for the OBIEE user that has been created, then the same login should have been present in the Argus Safety Instance as well. The OPVA ETLs when run would have already picked up the relevant Enterprise, Case Processing Site, Study, and Product accesses that the user 'admin' has in the Argus Safety Instance and the OPVA RPD applies the same in the PVA requests created via Answers or in the Dashboards.</p>
<p>3. There is no data in Argus Saftey at the time you are trying to access these reports.</p>

<h3 class="sect2"><span class="secnum">2.3.2</span> Working with Oracle Business Intelligence</h3>
<p>In the Oracle BI Enterprise Edition (BI EE), you can work with:</p>
<p><span class="bold">Analysis</span></p>
<p>This area of OBIEE is also known as Answers. Analysis are queries against an organization's data that provide answers to business questions. Analysis allows you to explore and interact with information by visually presenting data in easy-to-understand formats (such as tables and graphs). You can save, organize, and share the results of analysis. Your organization might also have purchased prebuilt analysis specific to your industry. Pre-built analysis can be used as purchased or modified to suit the information needs of your business.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Dashboards</span></p>
<p>This area of OBIEE is also known as Interactive Dashboards. Dashboards provide personalized views of corporate and external information. A dashboard consists of one or more pages that contain content, such as analyses, links to Web sites, Oracle BI Publisher reports, and so on. Dashboards allow you to provide end users with access to analytics information. Your organization might also have purchased preconfigured dashboards that contain prebuilt analyses specific to your industry.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Filters, Selection Steps, and Prompts</span></p>
<p>Filters, selection steps, and prompts allow you to limit or specify the data that is displayed in dashboards and analyses.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Agents</span></p>
<p>This area of OBIEE is also known as Delivers. Agents enable you to automate your business processes. You can use agents to provide event-driven alerting, scheduled content publishing, and conditional event-driven action execution. Agents can be scheduled or can be triggered by a specific condition, which enables you to deliver timely information to users.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Conditions</span></p>
<p>Conditions are objects that return a single Boolean value that is based on the evaluation of an analysis or of a Key Performance Indicator (KPI). You use conditions to determine whether something is to be done, for example whether an agent is to deliver its content.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Actions</span></p>
<p>Actions provide functionality to navigate to related content or to invoke operations, functions, or processes in external systems. You can include actions in various objects, such as analyses and dashboard pages. Actions allow users to take the proper action based on the business insight that they gained from the data that they received.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Scorecards</span></p>
<p>This area of OBIEE is known as Oracle Scorecard and Strategy Management. Scorecards allow you to model the objectives and initiatives that comprise your corporate strategy, evaluate their performance by assigning KPIs, and determine and display overall performance.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Other Products</span></p>
<p>OBIEE interacts in various ways with other products. For example, with the Oracle Business Intelligence Add-in for Microsoft Office, you can access and run analyses from OBIEE directly within your Microsoft Office workspace.</p>
<div id="OANEP523" class="sect3"><!-- infolevel="all" infotype="General" --><a id="sthref19"></a>
<h4 class="sect3"><span class="secnum">2.3.2.1</span> Oracle Business Intelligence Interactive Dashboards</h4>
<p>Dashboards provide personalized views of corporate and external information. A dashboard consists of one or more pages. Pages can display anything that you can access or open with a Web browser, including the following:</p>
<p>The results of analysis - The result of an analysis is the output returned from the Oracle BI Server that matches the analysis criteria. It can be shown in various views, such as a table, graph, and gauge. Users can examine and analyze results, print as PDF or HTML, save as PDF, or export them to a spreadsheet.</p>
<p>Alerts from agents</p>
<p>Action links and action link menus</p>
<p>Images</p>
<p>Text</p>
<p>Views of folders in the Oracle BI Presentation Catalog</p>
<p>Links to websites</p>
<p>Links to documents</p>
<p>Embedded content (such as Web pages or documents)</p>
<p>Oracle BI Publisher Reports</p>
<p>When you open a dashboard, the content of the dashboard is displayed in one or more dashboard pages. Dashboard pages are identified by tabs across the top of the dashboard. A toolbar at the top right contains buttons that let you:</p>
<p>Edit the dashboard, if you have the appropriate permissions and privileges</p>
<p>Display various options for working with a Dashboard Page, such as printing the current page</p>

<h4 class="sect3"><span class="secnum">2.3.2.2</span> Oracle Business Intelligence Analysis</h4>
<p>An analysis is a query against an organization's data that provides answers to business questions. A query contains the underlying SQL statements that are issued to the Oracle BI Server.</p>
<p>Analysis let you explore and interact with information by visually presenting data in tables, graphs, pivot tables, and so on. You can save, organize, and share the results of analyses.</p>
<p>Analysis that you create can be saved in the Oracle BI Presentation Catalog and integrated into any OBIEE dashboard. Analyses can be enhanced through features such as graphs, result layout, calculated items, and drilling.</p>

<h4 class="sect3"><span class="secnum">2.3.2.3</span> Oracle Business Intelligence Agents</h4>
<p>Agents enable you to automate your business processes. You can use them to provide event-driven alerting, scheduled content publishing, and conditional event-driven action execution.</p>
<p>You can choose:</p>
<p>A schedule that the Agent runs on</p>
<p>A data condition that determines what the Agent does</p>
<p>An analysis that can be distributed</p>
<p>Actions that can be automatically executed depending on whether the data condition is met</p>
<p>Agents can dynamically detect information-based problems and opportunities, determine the appropriate individuals to notify, and deliver information to them through a wide range of devices such as e-mail, phones, etc.</p>

<h3 class="sect2"><span class="secnum">2.5.1</span> What is Available to You After Accessing Oracle BI?</h3>
<p>After signing in to OBIEE, you are presented with one of the following pages, depending on what has been configured for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Your personal dashboard, named My Dashboard</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Home page</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A dashboard that is specific to your job function</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This page is your starting point for working in OBIEE. As you work, you can use the global header and the Home page as the primary ways to navigate OBIEE.</p>
<ul>
<li>

<h4 class="sect3"><span class="secnum">2.5.4.3</span> Sorting Options Menu and Buttons</h4>
<p>This section explains about sorting values in columns.</p>
<div id="OANEP988" class="sect4"><a id="sthref35"></a>
<h5 class="sect4"><span class="secnum">2.5.4.3.1</span> Sorting Mechanisms</h5>
<p>You can use one of the following mechanisms to sort values in columns:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Right-click in the column header of pivot tables and tables to display the following list of options for sorting the columns. In the Selected Columns pane, click the Options button. You can also right-click to display the Right-Click Menu for Tables and Pivot Tables, where you can select options for sorting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Sort Ascending</span> - Sorts the values in the column by ascending order, as a first-level sort. For example, string values sort alphabetically A through Z, numbers sort lowest to highest, and dates sort earliest to latest. In the Selected Columns pane, when you select this option as the first sort, a Sort button is displayed to the left of the column name in the Selected Columns pane. If you later add another sort, then the Sort button includes the number 1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Sort Descending</span> - Sorts the values in the column by descending order, as a first-level sort. In the Selected Columns pane, when you select this option as the first sort, a Sort button is displayed to the left of the column name in the Selected Columns pane. If you later add another sort, then the Sort button includes the number 1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Add Ascending Sort</span> - Specifies that an ascending sort for this column is added as another sort for the analysis. In the Selected Columns pane, when you select this option, a Sort button with a number such as 2 or 3 is displayed to the left of the column name in the Selected Columns pane.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Add Descending Sort</span> - Specifies that an descending sort for this column is added as another sort for the analysis. In the Selected Columns pane, when you select this option, a Sort button with a number such as 2 or 3 is displayed to the left of the column name in the Selected Columns pane.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Clear Sort</span> - Removes the sort specification for the specified column. This option works differently in the Selected Columns pane than in other places. If you make sort specifications in both the Selected Columns pane and in the view itself, then you return to the Selected Columns pane and click Clear Sort, only the sort that you specified in the Selected Columns pane is removed. A sort that you specified in the view remains.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Clear Sorts in All Columns or Clear All Sorts in View</span> - Removes all sort specifications that you have made. The Clear Sorts in All Columns option works differently in the Selected Columns pane than in other places. If you make sort specifications in both the Selected Columns pane and in the view itself, then you return to the Selected Columns pane and click Clear Sorts for All Columns, only the sorts that you specified in the Selected Columns pane are removed. Sorts that you specified in the view remain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hover the mouse pointer over the area to the right of the column name in the header of a pivot table or table and click either the upward facing triangle (Sort Ascending) or the downward facing triangle (Sort Descending) for that column. These sort specifications override those that you make with the right-click menu. Hovering is not available in the Selected Columns pane.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you see a shaded-in sort button in the column header or the row header, then you know that the column contains a primary sort. You can add a second-level or third-level sort by hovering over another innermost column header or row header and clicking the appropriate sort button.</p>
<p>These options are also available in the Results tab: Data View editor, the Results tab: Table editor, and in views on dashboards. The Sort Ascending and Sort Descending triangles are not available in the Selected Columns pane or the Layout pane.</p>

<h3 class="sect2"><span class="secnum">2.5.5</span> Drilling In Results</h3>
<p>Many of the results that are displayed in views represent hierarchical data structures. The metadata specifies these hierarchies, and this enables you to access the different levels of detail within them. For example, information in a sales graph might be categorized by region. Clicking a specific region in the graph might display each country within that region, if the country is the next level within the hierarchy of the metadata. Such clicking is referred to as drilling.</p>
<p>If the content designer has set up views for drilling, then you can drill in them on dashboards.</p>
<div id="OANEP989" class="sect3"><!-- infolevel="all" infotype="General" --><a id="sthref37"></a>
<h4 class="sect3"><span class="secnum">2.5.5.1</span> What Is Drilling?</h4>
<p>Drilling is a way to navigate through data in views quickly and easily.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You drill down to display data in more detail, which displays more members.</p>
<p>You can drill down to an actual item in the database. For example, if you work in sales, you can drill down to the city level within a sales analysis, and observe that there is a large sale pending in Paris.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You drill up to display data in less detail, in hierarchical columns.</p>
<p>For example, you might drill up from a month value to see a summary for the whole year. You can drill up in the current hierarchy, either for the entire column at the header level or for individual members. You can drill up from District to Region. Drilling up hides the current level (such as District) and retains the higher level (such as Region).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<!-- class="sect3" -->
<div id="OANEP990" class="sect3"><!-- infolevel="all" infotype="General" --><a id="sthref38"></a>
<h4 class="sect3"><span class="secnum">2.5.5.2</span> Where Can I Drill?</h4>
<p>You can drill in the following types of views:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Table and Pivot Table</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Graphs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Maps</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drilling in Tables and Pivot Tables</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When you drill down in a table or a pivot table, the detail level data is added to the current data. For example, when you drill from a continent, the table displays data for the continent and for the countries in that continent. For an attribute column, the list of members in the header is expanded, and it includes the original member.</p>
<p>The way that you drill in tables and pivot tables depends on the column type, as described in the following sections:</p>
<div id="OANEP991" class="sect4"><!-- infolevel="all" infotype="General" --><a id="sthref39"></a>
<h5 class="sect4"><span class="secnum">2.5.5.2.1</span> Drilling in Attribute Columns</h5>
<p>To drill in an attribute column, click the heading or member in which you want to drill. When you hover over the value before clicking, an underline is displayed below the value to indicate that you can click to drill.</p>
<p>When you drill in an attribute column, you add the lower level to the view. All views are affected by drilling in an attribute column, which is equivalent to a filter drill. After you click the value, a column is added to the analysis and a filter is automatically created and listed in the Criteria tab.</p>
<p>You cannot drill on groups for attribute columns. To see the definition of a group for an attribute column, edit the corresponding step in the Selection Steps pane.</p>
</div>
<!-- class="sect4" -->
<div id="OANEP992" class="sect4"><!-- infolevel="all" infotype="General" --><a id="sthref40"></a>
<h5 class="sect4"><span class="secnum">2.5.5.2.2</span> Drilling in Hierarchical Columns</h5>
<p>To drill in a hierarchical column, click the Expand and Collapse icons beside the members. Click to expand or collapse one level. For example, expanding from Total Products to Products inserts the Product members while retaining the value for Total Products.</p>
<p>When you drill in a hierarchical column, you expand and collapse the nodes of data that are in the view. Drilling in a hierarchical column affects only that particular view. No other views are affected.</p>
<p>Drilling in level-based hierarchies and value-based hierarchies works the same. Each time you drill in a hierarchy, you expand or collapse one level. For example, if the hierarchy has a level for continents, regions, and cities, and the view shows continent data, you can expand from Australia down one level to display regions in Australia. From there, you can expand one level from a region, to cities in that region, or you can collapse one level, back to continents.</p>
<p>When you drill, the drill state is preserved. If you collapse at a higher level and re-expand, then the members are re-displayed at the same drill point.</p>
<p>When you click the Collapse icon, you collapse back to the current level any levels in the hierarchy that are present in the analysis, regardless of whether they were added by drilling down or by adding the levels from the Subject Areas pane.</p>
<p>You can perform asymmetric drilling, which enables you to drill various members to different levels. For example, if you expand World, then you might see Americas, Asia, and Australia at the same second-level for continents. You can then drill Americas to expand it and see its regions, while Asia and Australia are not expanded.</p>
<p>You can expand and collapse the members of a group for hierarchical columns. For example, if you have a group that includes cities and the group is included in a view, then you see the cities when you click the group name.</p>

<h5 class="sect4"><span class="secnum">2.5.5.2.3</span> Drilling in Graphs</h5>
<p>When you drill down in a graph, the detail level data replaces the current data. For example, when you drill down from a continent, the graph displays data for the countries in that continent, but not for the continent itself.</p>
<p>You can drill down in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can click a label (for which drilling is available) on any axis or in the legend to drill down. A change in the mouse pointer indicates that drilling is available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the graph contains only attribute columns and measure columns, then you can click a data point to drill all columns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the graph contains multiple columns including at least one hierarchical column, then when you click a label or a data point, you see a menu from which you can select which columns to drill down. If there are action links available, then the menu also displays those links.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You do not drill up in a graph. Click the <span class="bold">Back</span> button on the browser to return to a previous graph.</p>
<div class="infobox-note">
<p class="notep1">Note:</p>
The time series line graph does not support drill down on a time column where data types other than data or date-time are used.</div>
