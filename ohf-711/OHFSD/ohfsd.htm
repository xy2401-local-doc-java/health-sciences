<p>You can use the filters at the top of the page to focus on preferred organization providers, physicians, or calendar years. The page has the following reports:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Overview - An overview of counts in a Hospital enterprise including number of the patients, discharges, emergency department patients, inpatients, and outpatients. This helps you to compare the inflow and outflow of patients, and to allocate resources based on the distribution of patient care efforts between emergency, ambulatory and inpatient services.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Number of patients or encounters by admission type. This report allows you to see the inflow of patients that go through different admission types (referral, transfer, emergency, etc.) and to adjust your admission operations accordingly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Number of discharges by diagnosis - Modify this report to show the number of discharges for a specific diagnosis of interest. You can correlate this report with the Top 10 Diagnoses report and see if they are proportional. If the number of discharges for a specific diagnosis is trailing, it may indicate a long-term tendency for cases with that specific diagnosis to accumulate in the organization. You may want to investigate such situations and address them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Number of encounters by organization. This report allows you to see the workload distribution between your organizations and plan your staffing, budgeting, and resource allocations accordingly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>% of encounters by diagnosis - Modify this report to show the % of encounters for a specific diagnosis of interest. You can use this report to estimate the mix of specialists that you need, based on the workloads that the various types of treatments require.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Number of encounters by inpatient and outpatient. The balance between the inpatient and outpatient services you provide may help your organization adjust its focus either on clinics or hospitals.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Number of encounters by top 10 diagnosis - Modify this report to show the number of encounters for a specific diagnosis of interest. You can use this report to see which treatments that you provide are the most labor intensive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Number of discharges by year and month on a time series. You can correlate this report with the number of encounters by year-end and see if there are any seasonal slow-downs in treatment delivery.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Number of encounters by year and month on a time series. You can use this report to see the long-term trends and seasonal spikes in workload.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Number of discharges by ethnicity - Shows a comparative analysis of number of discharges over two years by ethnicity. Modify this report to show the number of discharges for specific years of interest. You can correlate this report with the number of encounters by ethnicity to see if there is a systematic tendency to discharge members of certain ethnic groups after fewer investigations than the baseline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Number of encounters by ethnicity - Shows a comparative analysis of the number of encounters over two years by ethnicity. Modify this report to show the number of encounters for specific years of interest. You can correlate this report with the number of discharges by ethnicity to see if there is a systematic tendency to discharge members of certain ethnic groups after fewer investigations than the baseline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Patient encounter analysis by gender - Shows the workload distribution between male and female patients. You can use this report to plan gender-specific healthcare measures.</p>
