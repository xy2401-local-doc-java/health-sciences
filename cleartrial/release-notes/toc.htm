<p class="booktitle">Release Notes</p>
<p><span class="revnumber">Release 5.7</span></p>
<p class="invpartnumber">E95413-01</p>
<p class="date">April 2018</p>
<p>5.7 brings new and enhanced capabilities to Oracle Health Sciences ClearTrial Plan and Source Cloud Service for increased accuracy, flexibility, efficiency, and transparency for your study planning, forecasting, budgeting, and outsourcing needs.</p>
<p>This update also includes a NEW ClearTrial 5.7 Cost Model. Upgrade your plans and user-defined templates so that you can take advantage of the latest costing algorithms.</p>
<a id="A135106414"></a>
<div class="sect1"><!-- infolevel="all" infotype="General" -->
<h2 class="sect1">Technical Requirements</h2>
<p><span class="bold">Important:</span> ClearTrial 5.7 no longer operates with versions of Microsoft Internet Explorer for which Microsoft has ended support. Please upgrade to a currently supported version of Microsoft Internet Explorer (11 or Edge) or, as recommended, use Google Chrome to access the service. For more information, see the <code dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/indexes/products/browser-policy-2859268.html">Oracle Software Web Browser Support Policy</a><a href=""></a></code>.</p>
<p>5.7 also includes an update to the minimum Screen Resolution or Size to 1366 x 768 pixels.</p>
<p>For more information on ClearTrial's minimum and recommended configurations, please visit the latest version of the <code dir="ltr"><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/health-sciences/cleartrial/tech-reqs.html">Technical Requirements</a><a href=""></a></code>, accessible from the new <code dir="ltr"><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/health-sciences/cleartrial/index.html">Oracle Help Center</a><a href=""></a></code>.</p>

<div class="sect1"><!-- infolevel="all" infotype="General" -->
<h2 class="sect1">Best Practices</h2>
<p>As with every update, we are keen to offer the ClearTrial recommended best practices to ensure you are most effective in your usage and budgeting operations.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Lock your plans</span> if you do not want users to change any assumption values you entered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Freeze billing rates</span> anytime you are satisfied with your operational budget's forecast.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Upgrade existing plans and custom templates</span> to the latest cost model that ClearTrial offers.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Why?</span> Upgrading plans and user-defined templates to the latest cost model ensures you are working with the latest updates to fees and costs included in both the ClearTrial Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and indirect (pass-through or miscellaneous) cost calculations. Existing plans and user-defined templates do not automatically get upgraded with each update that includes a new, available cost model.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="sect1">Increased Transparency into Monitoring Efforts</h2>
<p><span class="bold">What's changed?</span> The existing effort calculated for the "Monitored, Clean CRF Page" Major Task has been broken out into two distinct Major Tasks and Tasks to account for SDV and non-SDV related activities.</p>
<p>Existing 5.6 Major Task, "Onsite Monitoring Visit - Prep, Travel, Reporting and Follow-up" has been updated to "Onsite Monitoring Visit - Non-SDV Activity" and includes two additional Tasks for other onsite time and trip report review activities. Two new Tasks include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Onsite monitoring visit - Perform other onsite monitoring activities</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Onsite monitoring visit - Trip Report Review</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The new Task for other time onsite is driven by a new "Other hours onsite per visit" assumption located on the Monitoring tab of your plans. This field allows you to specify the number of hours expected during each visit to perform activities not directly related to source document verification.</p>
<p><a id="sthref9"></a><span class="subhead3">Separate Drug Accountability Visit Updates&nbsp;</span>To more accurately account for the various activities under the existing Separate Drug Accountability Major Task, the following Tasks have been added:</p>
<ul>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Travel to site to perform separate drug accountability visit</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>ClearTrial 5.7 brings various enhancements to the out-of-the-box reporting capabilities, and offers extended configurability and control to create and build the reports you need, on demand.</p>
<a id="CHDJICGG"></a>
<div class="sect2"><!-- infolevel="all" infotype="General" -->
<h3 class="sect2">Compare Templates</h3>
<p><span class="bold">What's new?</span> The ability to compare templates, akin to how you compare plans, to quickly assess the impact and differences between multiple templates.</p>
<p><span class="bold">How do I compare templates?</span></p>
<ol>

<p>From the <span class="bold">Templates</span> screen, launched from <span class="bold">Maintain</span> &gt; <span class="bold">Templates</span>, select the templates you want to compare.</p>

</ol>
</div>
<!-- class="sect2" -->
<div class="sect2"><!-- infolevel="all" infotype="General" --><a id="sthref11"></a>
<h3 class="sect2">Enhanced Summary Grid Report</h3>
<p>The Summary Grid report looks and works better than ever. With extensive configurable reporting parameters, you can create the type of Bid Grid report required by your vendors or effectively replace your existing internal vendor selection tools and processes to have them reside alongside other planning and contracting data, in a single data source.</p>
<p>Managing Bid Grid reports outside of ClearTrial can be costly by creating multiple disparate, interoperable sources of data making it harder over time to harvest to drive insight. Leveraging ClearTrial for both your study budget planning, forecasting, outsourcing and contracting (including bid grid reporting), offers one single, secure, traceable repository to harvest all your trial data over time.</p>
<p><span class="bold">New name:</span> The Summary Grid by Major Task report launched from the Reports tab of your plan has been renamed the Summary Grid report</p>
<p><span class="bold">New reporting groupings:</span> This summary level plan report will always include data at the Major Task level, with the flexibility to choose from a list of available groupings for which you want to group by in the report. This includes grouping data by Provider, Location, Major Task or Cost, Task and Resource.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Configurable sort order:</span> Ability to configure the sort order of the data groupings displayed in the report output.</p>
<p><span class="bold">New option for multiple provider selection:</span> Akin to other ClearTrial-defined reports, in the new Providers to Include section, you can now select multiple or 'All Providers' from the list of providers in your plan.</p>
<p><span class="bold">New rollup options:</span> Two new options, Rollup provider level data and Rollup location level data, to rollup data across All Provider' or across All Locations.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Changes to pre-populated data options:</span> With one click, you can quickly and easily generate a populated grid with all values for hours or costs based on the levels of data you selected to display or create a blank grid to start with.</p>
<p><span class="bold">New option Include inflation:</span> Use this option to include or exclude inflation in the report. If inflation is included, you will see an explicit note displayed at the top of the report to indicate that inflation was added, in case you have to revisit the report at a later time and can't remember what you selected when you ran the report.</p>
<p><span class="bold">New option Include zero hours/costs:</span> If you want to obtain the same report structure, select this option so that all hours and costs including those that are set or calculated as zero, are displayed in the report.</p>
<p><span class="bold">New option Include excluded tasks/costs:</span> If you want to obtain the same report structure, i.e., have the same number of line items each time you run this report, select this option to include tasks or costs that were excluded from the plan at any stage of your budget cycle. Selecting this option dynamically selects and disables the include zero hours/costs option in the report.</p>
<div class="infobox-note">
<p class="notep1">Note:</p>
Any calculated or existing fees for tasks which have been excluded will be associated with the last assigned provider for that task.</div>
<p><span class="bold">New flat-file format for Excel analysis:</span> If you intend to use this report to feed data visualization programs or to create pivot tables with as little manipulation required, this option creates a flat-file format that is suitable for offline excel analysis. This format includes exclusive updates including non-merged cells per data point and updated header data, so you can easily insert this report into your Statement of Work (SOW) or RFP Bundle.</p>

<div class="sect2"><!-- infolevel="all" infotype="General" --><a id="sthref12"></a>
<h3 class="sect2">Resources by Department and Resources by GL Code Reports</h3>
<p><span class="bold">New options to include indirect costs:</span> You have the flexibility to include or exclude all indirect (pass-through or miscellaneous) costs or include only those indirect cost items specified to be included in the report from the Costs tab of your plan.</p>
<p><span class="bold">New options to include or exclude resources with no hours and costs with no amount:</span> These items were previously excluded from the two reports automatically. The ability to include these items in reports is useful if you're interested in generating a report with the same number of rows and columns each time. With a consistent report, you can set up templates or Excel formulas to help you work better with these reports outside of ClearTrial.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Updated column and new column:</span> The # Units column used to display both the value and unit of measure. Now it strictly includes a numeric value so that, in Excel, you can use this column for calculations. The unit of measure is now displayed separately in the new Unit column directly to the right of # Units.</p>
<p>In the <span class="bold">XLS format of the report</span>, cells with no value no longer contain N/A, instead they are blank to allow for use of formulas.</p>

<p>Continuous user account governance by ClearTrial System Administrators is recommended to effectively manage all users at any given time, for your organization. This can be done easily with the existing ClearTrial-defined Plan Inventory Report and the updated User Report.</p>

<div class="sect2"><a id="sthref14"></a>
<h3 class="sect2">Fixed Unit Prices Report</h3>
<p><span class="bold">What's changed?</span> The Fixed Unit Prices report has been enhanced to give you a more refined and cleaner output that is easier to read.</p>
<p><span class="bold">New option to include estimated start, end dates and duration:</span> You have the upfront flexibility on the report input screen to include the start date, end date and duration per Major Task, so you don't have to delete these data points each time you run the report, if they are not needed.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Eliminated redundant data display:</span> The Number of Units, which each task inherits from its Major Task, and the Unit of Measure display has been consolidated into single, adjacent cells in the Major Task subtotal row.</p>

<!-- class="sect2" -->
<div class="sect2"><a id="sthref15"></a>
<h3 class="sect2">Pass-Through and 3rd Party Costs Report</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">New option to show inflation on a separate line:</span> Displays inflation as a separate line item in the report.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">New option to include estimated dates for costs:</span> To exclude existing timeline details per cost, you have the flexibility to choose if you want to include the cost start date and cost end date, instead of having to remove them manually each time from the report output.</p>

</ul>

<!-- class="sect2" -->

<h3 class="sect2">Milestone Dates Report</h3>
<p>A new column, <span class="bold">Days from Last</span>, has been added to the right of each milestone date, which displays the number of days from the last milestone so that you can easily insert this report in your SOW or RFP Bundle to provide an overview of the timeline and key progress points.</p>

<div class="sect2"><a id="sthref17"></a>
<h3 class="sect2">Capacity Planning Reports</h3>
<p>The Resource Name and Resource Code sometimes concatenated in the UI are displayed in separate columns instead of being merged so you have quick, easy access to each data point from a single cell.

<ul>
<li>
<p>Resource/FTE Demand Summary</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Resources By Major Task</p>

<p>At the Major Task Adjustments level and the Resource Hours level, you will see a new column inserted between the planned or calculated value and the adjusted value to apply a positive or negative offset, instead of overriding the adjusted value itself.

<h2 class="sect1">Import Additional Location-specific Overrides from a Plan or Template</h2>
<p>This enhancement expands on to the existing capability, introduced in update 5.6, to import location-specific overrides from another plan or template, when adding a location to your plan.</p>
<p><span class="bold">What's changed?</span> Additional location-specific overrides can be pulled into your plan or template.</p>

<h2 class="sect1">Custom Algorithms and Custom Fields Validated for Calculation Errors</h2>
<p><span class="bold">What's changed?</span> When creating or updating custom field default formulas or custom algorithms via script, ClearTrial validates the plan for any errors that you may have introduced. For example, if your user-defined formula for a cost item contains a division by zero, a new <span class="bold">View Plan Errors</span> link appears in the top right of your plan which allows you to view error details or download the list of errors to distribute to other users.</p>
<p><span class="bold">Who sees the change?</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If an error is introduced while your Expert Algorithm Editor is defining a custom algorithm via script, for a resource or indirect cost, when another user opens that plan, they will also see the View Plan Errors alert in the plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If your Custom Field Designer introduces an error while defining a custom field in one of your custom field models, only that user with the Custom Field Designer will see the alert, since they are the only ones who can fix it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Other types of errors ClearTrial validates for are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Issues in task-resource or indirect cost algorithms:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You are using variables that do not exist in the ClearTrial or the current custom field model published and applied to the plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The algorithm divides by zero due to an assumption or custom field whose value has become 0.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The custom algorithm now returns a negative value.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Issues in custom field default value formulas:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You are using variables that do not exist in ClearTrial or the current custom field model published and applied to the plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Algorithm divides by zero.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The result of your formula is outside the expected range.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The formula now returns a negative value.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="sect1">New Duration-based Variables for Custom Algorithms using Script</h2>
<p><span class="bold">What's new?</span> Six new duration-based variables are now accessible for use when defining custom algorithms using script:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>numMonths: Number of months between the PASD and Final CSR.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>numMonthsForCost: Number of months during which this cost occurs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>numMonthsForTask: Number of months during which the effort occurs for a Task.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>numDays: Number of days between the PASD and Final CSR.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>numDaysForCost: Number of days during which the cost occurs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>numDaysForTask: Number of days during which the effort occurs for a Task.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="bold">Who sees the change?</span> Expert Algorithm Editors who are defining custom algorithms when switching to script.</p>
<div class="infobox-note">
<p class="notep1">Reminder:</p>
Defining custom algorithms with script is launched by navigating to the <span class="bold">Cost</span> &gt; <span class="bold">Adjustments</span> tab for an indirect cost item or the <span class="bold">Resource</span> &gt; <span class="bold">Algorithm</span> (or <span class="bold">Algorithm/Hours</span>) tab for a resource working on a task and clicking on the <span class="bold">Switch to Script</span> link.</div>
