<p class="invpartnumber">E95838-01</p>
<p class="date">April 2018</p>
<p>If you haven't used ClearTrial in a while and want to know what's changed beyond the most recent update, this document has the information you need. This document is a collection of information from the Release Notes for previous versions of ClearTrial, from oldest to most recent, excluding the current version.</p>
<div class="sect1"><!-- infolevel="all" infotype="General" --><a id="sthref1"></a>
<h2 class="sect1">Changes in Update 5.3</h2>
<p>Update 5.3 includes enhancements to the Oracle ClearTrial Plan and Source Cloud Service. This section highlights changes from the previous release of the software, 5.2.</p>
<div class="sect2"><!-- infolevel="all" infotype="General" --><a id="sthref2"></a>
<h3 class="sect2">New Assumption for Monitoring Minutes for CRF Pages</h3>
<p>ClearTrial 5.3 provides an additional treatment assumption to accommodate monitoring minutes needed for CRF pages. On the Edit Plan screen, from the Treatment tab, you now have the option to enter the monitoring minutes per CRF page for each treatment in the study.</p>
<p>The application calculates the default value for the Monitoring Minutes per CRF Page field based on the study phase and therapeutic indication. You can override this value for each treatment. Overridden values do not affect minute per page values for the baseline visit or washout period for a crossover study.</p>
<div class="sect3"><!-- infolevel="all" infotype="General" --><a id="sthref3"></a>
<h4 class="sect3">Enhancements to Assumptions and Metrics Reports</h4>
<p>The Assumptions report now includes an assumption for the monitoring minutes per CRF page for each treatment included in your study.</p>
<p>The Metric report now includes an assumption for the average number of minutes to monitor one CRF page.</p>
<p>The Assumption and Metrics reports are available on the Edit Plan screen, from the Reports tab.</p>
</div>
<!-- class="sect3" -->
<div class="sect3"><!-- infolevel="all" infotype="General" --><a id="sthref4"></a>
<h4 class="sect3">Enhancement to the Compare Plans Report</h4>
<p>The Compare Plans report now includes an assumption for the Monitoring Minutes per CRF page for each treatment included in you study, in the Treatment Details section of the Report. The Compare Plans report is available on the Plans screen.</p>
</div>
<!-- class="sect3" --></div>
<!-- class="sect2" -->
<div class="sect2"><!-- infolevel="all" infotype="General" --><a id="sthref5"></a>
<h3 class="sect2">New Data Assumptions for Repeat Tables, Listings, and Figures</h3>
<p>ClearTrial 5.3 provides new assumptions that allow you to accommodate repeated data tables, data listings, and figures and graphs. These fields are available from the Edit Plan screen, on the Data tab. The application calculates a default value for these fields based on the Number of Unique Pages field, however, you can override this value. These new assumptions are available for all study phases.</p>
<p>In addition, the repeat data tables, listings, and figures and graphs appear as work units you can select within task manager. These work units are available from the Edit Plan screen, from the task manager on the Labor tab.</p>
<p>This release also incorporates new assumptions for repeated PK/PD data tables, listings, and figures and graphs. These fields are available from the Edit Plan screen, on the Data tab.</p>
<div class="sect3"><!-- infolevel="all" infotype="General" --><a id="sthref6"></a>
<h4 class="sect3">Enhancements to Assumptions and Compare Assumptions Report</h4>
<p>The Assumptions report now includes assumptions for repeated data tables, data listings, and figures and graphs. The Assumptions report is available on the Edit Plan screen, from the Reports tab.</p>
<p>The Compare Assumptions report also includes assumptions for repeated data tables, data listings, and figures, and graphs. The Compare Assumptions report is available from the Plans screen by selecting two or more plans and clicking the <span class="bold">Compare</span> button.</p>
</div>
<!-- class="sect3" --></div>
<!-- class="sect2" -->
<div class="sect2"><!-- infolevel="all" infotype="General" --><a id="sthref7"></a>
<h3 class="sect2">User Configurable Columns</h3>
<p>Users can select which columns the application displays with the Configure List Options dialog box available from the Filter section on the Plans, Studies, Products, Templates, Portfolios, Resources, Departments, GL Codes, and Exchange Rate Tables screens. To access this feature, click the <span class="bold">Configure List Options</span> link.</p>
</div>
<!-- class="sect2" -->
<div class="sect2"><!-- infolevel="all" infotype="General" --><a id="sthref8"></a>
<h3 class="sect2">New Default Data Collection Method</h3>
<p>ClearTrial 5.3 has been updated to provide a new default data collection method on the Data tab, available from the Edit Plan screen. The new default when creating new plans is Electronic Data Capture (EDC). You can override this value by selecting another data collection method from the drop-down list.</p>
</div>
<!-- class="sect2" -->
<div class="sect2"><!-- infolevel="all" infotype="General" --><a id="sthref9"></a>
<h3 class="sect2">Rounding Values</h3>
<p>ClearTrial 5.3 includes changes for how values are rounded throughout the application.</p>
<div class="sect3"><!-- infolevel="all" infotype="General" --><a id="sthref10"></a>
<h4 class="sect3">Rounding Values in Plans</h4>
<p>On the Edit Plan screen, from the Summary tab, the application rounds to the thousandths place for hours by department.</p>
<p>All rates, unit costs, and extended costs that appear on the Edit Plan screen are now rounded to the number of decimal places that is the standard convention for the relevant currency. The application uses these rounded values for all calculations.</p>
</div>
<!-- class="sect3" -->
<div class="sect3"><!-- infolevel="all" infotype="General" --><a id="sthref11"></a>
<h4 class="sect3">Rounding Values in Task Manager</h4>
<p>In the Task Manager, on the Unit Hours tab, Major Task Adjustments tab, and the Adjustments tab, the default unit hours and unit hours round to thousandths place. The rounded value appears in the application and is used to calculate the unit cost and extended unit hours. Overridden values are also rounded to the thousands place.</p>
</div>
<!-- class="sect3" --></div>
<!-- class="sect2" --></div>
<!-- class="sect1" -->
<div class="sect1"><!-- infolevel="all" infotype="General" --><a id="sthref12"></a>
<h2 class="sect1">Changes in Update 5.4</h2>
<p>This section includes enhancements and updates to Oracle ClearTrial Plan and Source Cloud Service from the previous version, 5.3.</p>
<div class="sect2"><!-- infolevel="all" infotype="General" --><a id="sthref13"></a>
<h3 class="sect2">Important Note on Freezing Billing Rates</h3>
<p>Oracle ClearTrial 5.4 includes updates to composite billing rates for years 2017 &ndash; 2039.</p>
<p>Freezing rates remains an Oracle ClearTrial release best practice to preserve existing rates in 5.3 (or earlier) plans.</p>
</div>
<!-- class="sect2" -->
<div class="sect2"><!-- infolevel="all" infotype="General" --><a id="sthref14"></a>
<h3 class="sect2">Locking Plans Best Practice Update</h3>
<p>Locking plans preserves assumption values and freezes resource billing rates and inflation rates in existing plans.</p>
<p>Upon the release of 5.4, existing plans will no longer be automatically upgraded to the cost model associated with the latest release of ClearTrial Cloud Service.</p>
<p>Therefore, locking plans is no longer required to preserve values prior to a ClearTrial release. Locking plans is now strictly a method to prevent users from making inadvertent changes to an existing plan.</p>
</div>
<!-- class="sect2" -->
<div class="sect2"><!-- infolevel="all" infotype="General" --><a id="sthref15"></a>
<h3 class="sect2">Important Points on Existing Locked Plans that Are Unlocked/Copied</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When a plan that is locked to a version earlier than 5.3 is unlocked, it will be upgraded to the first supported cost model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Copies of a locked plan, locked to a version earlier than 5.3 will be upgraded to the first supported cost model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Copies of 5.3 locked plans will continue to use the 5.3 cost model, but users have the ability to upgrade per plan, on demand.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information, see Locking Plans: Information and Guidelines and Freezing Billing Rates: Information and Guidelines.</p>
</div>
<!-- class="sect2" -->
<div class="sect2"><!-- infolevel="all" infotype="General" --><a id="sthref16"></a>
<h3 class="sect2">Clinical Intelligence Updates</h3>
<p>Oracle ClearTrial 5.4 includes updates to composite billing and inflation rates.</p>
<div class="sect3"><!-- infolevel="all" infotype="General" --><a id="sthref17"></a>
<h4 class="sect3">Composite Billing Rate Updates</h4>
<p>Oracle ClearTrial 5.4 introduces composite billing rate updates for years 2016 to 2029, based on estimated inflation, observed provider billing rates by location, and industry salary projections. ClearTrial will adjust future years for inflation, according to the ClearTrial-defined inflation profiles, by location and year.</p>
<p>ClearTrial continuously monitors and aggregates changes in provider billing rates. These composite rates are reviewed annually and updated to ensure that the most current and accurate composite rates are available.</p>
</div>
<!-- class="sect3" -->
<div class="sect3"><!-- infolevel="all" infotype="General" --><a id="sthref18"></a>
<h4 class="sect3">Composite Inflation Rate Updates</h4>
<p>Oracle ClearTrial 5.4 introduces composite inflation rate updates for years 2016 to 2039, based on global economic data.</p>
<p>ClearTrial continuously monitors and aggregates changes in global inflation rates. These composite rates are reviewed annually and updated to ensure that the most current and accurate composite rates are available.</p>
</div>
<!-- class="sect3" --></div>
<!-- class="sect2" -->
<div class="sect2"><!-- infolevel="all" infotype="General" --><a id="sthref19"></a>
<h3 class="sect2">Introduction of Cost Model Versioning from 5.3+</h3>
<p>Oracle ClearTrial plans calculate level of effort, costs, distributions, and timelines logic, default values, and a work breakdown structure referred to as a &rdquo;cost model.&rdquo; A new cost model is created with every ClearTrial release and will now be referred to using the release version number. For example, upon release of 5.4, the cost model will be called &rdquo;cost model 5.4." <span class="bold">Oracle ClearTrial will now support multiple cost models simultaneously.</span></p>
<p>All cost models from 5.3 and forward will be preserved and available for use in plans.</p>
<div class="sect3"><!-- infolevel="all" infotype="General" --><a id="sthref20"></a>
<h4 class="sect3">Existing Plans and Templates</h4>
<p>Users will have the ability to decide whether or not to apply a cost model to a plan.</p>
<p>For example, users can choose to leave a plan (or template) created in cost model 5.3 in its current state. Should the user later choose to update an assumption or a default value in that plan, the plan values will recalculate using the logic from the 5.3 cost model.</p>
<p>Conversely, the user can choose to update a plan (or template) created in cost model 5.3 to cost model 5.4. In this case, the user's overwritten values will be preserved but all default values, logic, and tasks will be based on cost model 5.4. The plan labor and cost values will change to reflect the new model.</p>
<p>Cost models prior to version 5.3 have not been preserved; therefore, plans (or templates) locked to earlier versions (5.2 and less) when upgraded, will be upgraded to 5.3 at minimum, with the capability to upgrade to 5.4 on demand.</p>
</div>
<!-- class="sect3" -->
<div class="sect3"><!-- infolevel="all" infotype="General" --><a id="sthref21"></a>
<h4 class="sect3">Updating Plans to a new Cost Model: Best Practice</h4>
<p>If you have an existing plan or template that was locked prior to 5.3, you should not unlock it unless you are prepared to accept the changes that will occur as the plan adjusts to the oldest preserved cost model, which is the 5.3 cost model. Once the cost model is updated, you will not be able to revert the cost model back to a version prior to 5.3.</p>
<p>If you want to assess the potential impacts of a newer cost model on fees and costs without impacting your original plan, ClearTrial recommends that you:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Copy the plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Updating the cost model of the copy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compare the copy to the original plan.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you do not like the resulting changes, you can delete the updated copy and your original plan will still be available.</p>
</div>
<!-- class="sect3" -->
<div class="sect3"><!-- infolevel="all" infotype="General" --><a id="sthref22"></a>
<h4 class="sect3">New Plans and Templates</h4>
<p>If a user creates a new plan based on a custom template, the new plan will reflect the cost model of the template.</p>
<p>If a user creates a new plan based on the ClearTrial default template, the new plan will reflect the current version cost model.</p>
<p>If a user wants to create a new plan using an old custom template and the newest cost model, the user can either:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Create the plan based on the old custom template and then upgrade the plan to the newest cost model, or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upgrade the template to the newest cost model and then create the plan from the upgraded template.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<!-- class="sect3" -->
<div class="sect3"><!-- infolevel="all" infotype="General" --><a id="sthref23"></a>
<h4 class="sect3">Maintaining Templates: Best Practices</h4>
<p>As of 5.4, the following best practices are recommended upon release of the new cost model:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Copy your custom templates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upgrade them to the current cost model version.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Review the impact of ClearTrial's new cost model version.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Edit your templates, if necessary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instruct your users to create new plans based on the new templates.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can leave templates based on older cost models available for users or you can archive them.</p>
<div class="infobox-note">
<p class="notep1">Note:</p>
If you want the billing rates to remain the same from release to release, ClearTrial still recommends that you freeze rates prior to a new Oracle ClearTrial release because billing rates are not preserved as part of a cost model.</div>
</div>
<!-- class="sect3" --></div>
<!-- class="sect2" -->
<div class="sect2"><!-- infolevel="all" infotype="General" --><a id="sthref24"></a>
<h3 class="sect2">Custom Assumptions</h3>
<p>Oracle ClearTrial 5.4 allows Oracle Health Sciences ClearTrial Plan Enterprise Edition Cloud Service users to create their own custom assumptions. Users might want to create a custom assumption when ClearTrial does not have a defined assumption that meets their need for calculating a custom task or for use as a unit of measure for billing.</p>
<div class="sect3"><!-- infolevel="all" infotype="General" --><a id="sthref25"></a>
<h4 class="sect3">User Additional Roles/Capabilities</h4>
<p>Oracle ClearTrial 5.4 includes the additional role/capability of Custom Field Designer. This permission can be granted to users who need access to create custom fields and publish custom field models for use in plans. A training video is available for users who will be designated as custom field designers.</p>
<p>ClearTrial system administrators have this additional permission by default and can grant it to any user who is already assigned the Clinical Administrator or System Administrator primary role.</p>
</div>
<!-- class="sect3" --></div>
<!-- class="sect2" -->
<div class="sect2"><!-- infolevel="all" infotype="General" --><a id="sthref26"></a>
<h3 class="sect2">Bid Comparison across RFPs</h3>
<p>In 5.3, you could only compare bids that existed within the same RFP. Oracle ClearTrial 5.4 provides the ability to compare bids from different RFPs. This allows you to perform a comparison of bids that have been generated from copies of plans to see how bids have changed when the same trial's scenario is updated in response to vendors' alternatives.</p>
</div>
<!-- class="sect2" -->
<div class="sect2"><!-- infolevel="all" infotype="General" --><a id="sthref27"></a>
<h3 class="sect2">Line-item Discount Support</h3>
<p>Oracle ClearTrial 5.4 provides the ability to apply line-item discounts per plan per provider. Line-item discounts are not associated with any particular major task, task, resource, or rate. This kind of discount is a negotiated amount at the plan level that gets applied against the overall labor fees for a particular plan provider.</p>
<p>If you configure a line-item discount in your plan, all ClearTrial-defined reports have been updated to display discount impact to total fees. For the Metrics report, you can specify that the metric calculations consider line-item discount.</p>
</div>
<!-- class="sect2" -->
<div class="sect2"><!-- infolevel="all" infotype="General" --><a id="sthref28"></a>
<h3 class="sect2">New Units of Measurement/Cost Drivers</h3>
<p>Oracle ClearTrial 5.4 exposes additional items to be used as units of measurements when creating task-resource algorithms in Task Manager or as cost drivers when creating user-defined miscellaneous or pass-through costs on the Costs tab. The items below are now available to be used as units of measurements or cost drivers.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pre-study Site Visit*</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Site Initiation Visit*</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Site Close-out Visit*</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Newsletter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Publication</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>*Related to onsite visits only, not phone visits.</p>
</div>
<!-- class="sect2" -->
<div class="sect2"><!-- infolevel="all" infotype="General" --><a id="sthref29"></a>
<h3 class="sect2">Increased Transparency for Meetings Labor</h3>
<p>Oracle ClearTrial 5.4 provides increased transparency for meetings. In 5.3, meeting tasks were created for each unique provider attending the meeting. Regardless of billing location, multiple occurrences of the same resource for a meeting were merged together into one resource in the WBS. The billing rates for those resources were blended to derive the associated fees.In 5.4, meeting tasks will now be created for each unique provider, resource, and billing location combination. When the associated fees are calculated, the billing rates are no longer blended. The actual billing rate for the resource's billing location will be used to derive the associated fees.</p>
</div>
<!-- class="sect2" -->
<div class="sect2"><!-- infolevel="all" infotype="General" --><a id="sthref30"></a>
<h3 class="sect2">Metrics Updated to Include Inflation</h3>
<p>Oracle ClearTrial 5.4 provides increased flexibility by allowing the user to apply inflation to metrics. Because ClearTrial-defined metric calculations are not versioned, metrics with the option to include inflation will be available in 5.3 plans.</p>
<p>The following metrics have been updated with the ability to include inflation on the ClearTrial-defined Metrics Report:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Total study cost per CRF page (includes drop rate).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data management cost per CRF page (excludes Biostatistics).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Total study cost per on-site monitoring day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cost to monitor all sites for one additional month.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Average cost per monitoring trip (excludes pass-through costs).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Average cost for a single monitoring day (excludes pass-through costs).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cost per site per week.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Study startup costs per site per week.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cost per subject per site per week.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cost per completed subject.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Direct Fees per Enrolled Subject.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<!-- class="sect2" -->
<div class="sect2"><!-- infolevel="all" infotype="General" --><a id="sthref31"></a>
<h3 class="sect2">Bid Grid Versioning</h3>
<p>Oracle ClearTrial 5.4 introduces bid grid versioning, which preserves the format and metadata of a bid grid generated from ClearTrial RFPs even if bid grid changes occur in the next ClearTrial release. This feature allows you to continue to produce bid grids for negotiations that may span multiple releases with the same format and metadata.</p>
</div>
<!-- class="sect2" -->
<div class="sect2"><!-- infolevel="all" infotype="General" --><a id="sthref32"></a>
<h3 class="sect2">Usability Enhancements</h3>
<p>Usability enhancements are ongoing to enhance the ClearTrial user experience.</p>
<div class="sect3"><!-- infolevel="all" infotype="General" --><a id="sthref33"></a>
<h4 class="sect3">Sort Plans by Protocol and Product/Compound</h4>
<p>Oracle ClearTrial 5.4 provides additional data display options to sort by on List screens. Launched by clicking the <span class="bold">Configure List Options</span> link in the upper right-hand corner of the Plan List screen, Protocol and Product/Compound have been added as options for you to select from to display as columns by which to sort your plans As a reminder, if you have a large amount of plans, spanning multiple pages, you can also configure how many plans are shown per page by increasing the value for the <span class="bold">Show number of plans per page</span> assumption, located at the bottom of the same dialog box.</p>

<h2 class="sect1">Changes in Update 5.5</h2>
<p>This section includes enhancements and updates made to Oracle ClearTrial Plan and Source Cloud Service since version 5.4.</p>
<div class="sect2"><!-- infolevel="all" infotype="General" --><a id="sthref42"></a>
<h3 class="sect2">Advanced Algorithms</h3>
<p>Configurability capabilities currently exist at the labor and indirect cost levels to allow you to align to your organizational hierarchy or the mutually agreed upon work breakdown structure determined between you and your service provider(s). Oracle ClearTrial has become the platform that triggers contract negotiation discussions for complete alignment and transparency between both sides (sponsor, vendor) of the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Oracle ClearTrial 5.5 expands on existing user-defined algorithm building capabilities by allowing the configuration of multiple expressions with multiple cost drivers accessible per expression, per algorithm. This enhancement provides increased control and flexibility over how custom fees and costs are specified to align to their respective clinical trial scenario.</p>
<p>ClearTrial 5.5 also includes a new configurable assumption within each expression to apply a percentage of, per cost driver, per expression. This percentage will increase/decrease the number derived from the underlying assumption for the driver.</p>
<p>There may be ClearTrial-defined costs and fees included by default at a different level of granularity than those in which your organization needs or for your planned trial's budget. You can leverage the 5.5 advanced algorithm capabilities so that you can include those specific fees or costs in your budget, when you need them (on demand).</p>
</div>
<!-- class="sect2" -->
<div class="sect2"><!-- infolevel="all" infotype="General" --><a id="sthref43"></a>
<h3 class="sect2">New User Role/Additional Capability</h3>
<p>Oracle ClearTrial 5.5 includes the additional role/capability of Advanced Algorithm Editor. This permission is for users who need write access to create or edit task-resource /cost algorithms with multiple expressions.</p>
<p>Assigned ClearTrial System Administrators have this additional permission by default and can grant it to any user who is already assigned the Power User, Clinical Administrator, or System Administrator primary role.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect2"><!-- infolevel="all" infotype="General" --><a id="sthref44"></a>
<h3 class="sect2">New Medical Monitoring and Safety Assumptions</h3>
<p>Oracle ClearTrial 5.5 includes updates to existing medical monitoring and safety algorithms, including new, configurable assumptions used to calculate monitoring-related fees and costs accessible for late-stage studies, for users in Advanced/Expert mode.</p>
<p>All new assumptions/cost drivers will be displayed on associated out-of-the-box reports and accessible as a unit of measure to select from when creating user defined algorithms.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Lab and Diagnostic Tests</span> per subject, per treatment arm located on the Plan Treatment tab. This assumption's value is used to calculate the amount of time the medical monitor will spend reviewing lab and diagnostic test results.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Cohort Escalation Reviews</span> per treatment arm located on the Plan Treatment tab. This assumption's value is used to calculate the time required for the medical monitor and medical associate to determine appropriate changes in dosage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">24/7 Coverage for Medical Monitoring</span> located on the Plan Monitoring tab. This assumption's value is used to increase the estimated time the medical monitor and medical associate will spend performing subject eligibility reviews, answering specific inclusion/exclusion criteria questions, and reviewing subject management and protocol issues that require medical judgment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Medical Data Listing Reviews</span> located on the Plan Monitoring tab. This assumption's value is used to calculate the amount of time the medical monitor and medical associate will spend assessing point-to-point data, data across visits per subject, data across subjects per site, and data across the entire study.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3 class="sect2">Important Note for New Resource Department Assignments</h3>
<p>If your organization has never created custom department mappings prior to using the Maintain Departments capability, accessible from the Maintain menu, then the new resources available in 5.5 will contain a ClearTrial pre-defined default department mapping. However, if your organization has previously taken advantage of/leveraged this ability to manage and maintain your custom department mappings over time for your plans, then please review the mappings per resource post release. The new resources available in 5.5 will have "Unmapped" as their default department assignment. Please meet with your users and determine if the new resources need updated mappings based on your current organizational structure.</p>

<h3 class="sect2">Update to Responsibilities/Assignment Groups</h3>
<p>ClearTrial's 5.6 cost model offers the latest updates to the ClearTrial Responsibilities, also known as ClearTrial-defined Task/Assignment groups, and the tasks under each group.</p>
<p>Updates include new Responsibilities/Assignment groups and updates to existing ClearTrial Responsibilities group names and the order in which they are displayed on various tabs. The new task groups displayed for plans using the ClearTrial 5.6 cost model include:</p>
<p><span class="bold">Phase I (Oncology/Vaccines) through Phase IV or Late-Stage Plans:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Site Startup (New)</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Safety/Pharmacovigilance (Update to existing group Safety and Medical Management)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quality Assurance (Update to existing group Site Auditing)</p>
</li>

</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, existing ClearTrial-defined tasks have moved and will reside by default under different Responsibilities/Assignment groups in ClearTrial 5.6 cost model plans for both WBSs. As a result, default assignments for ClearTrial's Responsibilities have also changed when compared to plans using the ClearTrial 5.5 cost model.</p>
<p>If you have defined mappings for departments or GL codes by task or task group, you may wish to review these mappings after the upgrade.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Locations tab</span>&mdash;The footer row displays the total number of locations and updates dynamically if the number of locations changes.

<p><span class="bold">Task Manager</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>(Enterprise Edition only) The Distribution tab of a Major Task within Task Manager displays the number of weeks between the distribution start and end dates for each service provider/location.

<li>
<p>You can copy a user-defined task by selecting the task and clicking the <span class="bold">Copy Task</span> button.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <span class="bold">Code</span> field on the Task Details tab is now editable for ClearTrial-defined tasks. You can enter a code. You can edit it over time, when you edit the task later. You can also use it as a prefix to help order the list in which it is displayed in.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>On the Plan Reports tab, a new plan-level report, <span class="bold">Compare to Original</span>, has been added to compare the current plan to its template or prior copy and quickly see differences or changes in fees and costs.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Context-sensitive Help</span>&mdash;Two capabilities have been added:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can now select and copy the text from the context-sensitive help screens. When you click a field name to open the online help associated with the screen. The keystrokes depend on which browser you are using. For example, in Internet Explorer, click <span class="bold">CTRL+SHIFT+DBL-CLICK</span>. to copy the contents to the clipboard. In other browsers, these keystrokes make the text become selectable so you can copy all or part of the text.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The table of Major Tasks that appears in the help for the Labor tab is dynamic. It reflects tasks and Major Tasks that have been added or are unique to the current plan as well as any changes you make to the name or description.</p>

<h3 class="sect2">Especially for CRO Users</h3>
<p>Several capabilities to support have been included in ClearTrial 5.6 specifically for CRO users.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The header at the top of all screens includes Sponsor Name.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>You can display a Sponsor column on the Plans list screen. Select the <span class="bold">Configure List Options</span> link on the Plans list screen and select <span class="bold">Sponsor</span>. You can also filter the plans list by sponsor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When working with meetings tasks, meeting tasks assigned to sponsors have been removed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you open the Assignment ab, all tasks have been expanded by default.</p>
</li>
