<p>Creating a plan in Advanced mode yields more accurate results than working in Quick mode. In Advanced mode, you control approximately 120 input assumptions to fine-tune the operational approach and budget for your study. To work effectively, you need to have detailed specifications about how you will conduct the study and are ready to prepare an RFP or bid for a project or need to submit your budget to management for review and approval.</p>

<p>Study difficulty applies to other aspects of the study (site training, multiple locations, unusual monitoring conventions, sponsor micro management, and so on) not covered by the usual assumptions. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Several sites might require more than one location or visit or additional interaction with several clinical investigators or their staff; for example, pharmacy or hospital medical unit or record room.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sites might be approved and ready to receive a study drug in a very short time, requiring exceptional effort on the part of the vendor. Drug accountability might be atypical.</p>

<p>On the Locations tab, you specify locations for investigation sites and enrolling subjects. Enter assumptions in the fields that appear. Your edit mode determines the fields shown. For more information about a field, click the field name to display online help.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>On the <span class="bold">Locations</span> tab, click <span class="bold">Add Location(s)</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check <span class="bold">Regions</span>, <span class="bold">Countries</span>, or both.</p>
<div class="infoboxnotealso">
<p class="notep1">Tip:</p>
We recommend that you select either regions (if you are not sure of the exact countries) or specific countries (if you know which countries in which the study will be conducted).</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the locations to add.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choose a template or plan from which to import location-specific overrides.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This feature allows you to use a template your organization created that already has user-defined defaults such as assumption field values, assignments and pinning, GL code and department mapping, and adjustments to indirect costs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you remove a country, then add it back later, the user-defined defaults associated with that location will be reactivated.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click <span class="bold">Ok</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For each location, in the <span class="bold">Sites</span> box, enter the number of sites.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the <span class="bold">Subjects</span> box, enter the number of subjects to be given the study drug/device or an alternative treatment (for example, a placebo).</p>
<p>This field should contain only the number of subjects that will actually be enrolled in the trial. For example, if the protocol calls for 1000 subjects to be randomized, enter 1000.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the <span class="bold">Avg Grant Amount</span> box, enter the amount to be paid to each investigator in this location for each subject enrolled in the study. Select the currency from the drop-down list.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Do not include payments made for screen failures, university-related overhead, or other overhead associated with certain sites, or inflation. All of these items are accounted for on the Site tab.</p>
<p>ClearTrial includes the total for investigator grant payments as a pass-through cost in the budget.</p>
<div class="infoboxnotealso">
<p class="notep1">Tip:</p>
If you do not know the grant amount for a location, we recommend that you enter your best estimate or zero. If you enter zero for the grant amount for one location, we recommend that you enter zero for all locations, so that the final budget does not include the grant.</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>ClearTrial estimates costs based on completed and partially completed subjects. A completed subject gets 100% of the investigator grant amount. A dropped subject is estimated to require payment to an investigator of 75% of the grant. We expect the average to be closer to 75% of all visits completed since dropped subjects must return for a termination visits (generally a repeat of the last subject visit regardless of where the subject terminates).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can adjust these pass-through costs if specific knowledge of the prorated grant budget is known. For endpoint studies, be sure to include the grant costs for both the standard treatment and the full extended treatment schedules.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For some rare disease trials, grants might run as high as 500,000 USD per subject. However, this is not typical. Check that you have entered a per-subject amount. This field must contain a value between 0 and 500,000 USD (or the equivalent in another currency).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>For a <span class="bold">Ministry of Health (MOH) or Federal Drug Administration (FDA) approval time delay</span> for the location, add the number of days you expect the delay to last.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This value represents the number of elapsed days required in each location to obtain approval to proceed with the study. ClearTrial uses this number with other statistical factors to forecast the number of sites that should be approved by any particular date.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ClearTrial uses this forecast to suggest and validate assumptions regarding the first subject enrolled date (FSI/FPI), the enrollment distribution type, and the first quartile enrollment objectives You can override this value if necessary to reflect changes or other knowledge concerning the regulatory delay in any particular location.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can override the suggested FSI date, enrollment distribution type, and first quartile objectives, which are based on the site approval forecast derived in part from this value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a large number of sites are in countries with very long MOH/FDA approval times, there may not be enough sites approved at the First Subject Enrolled date to meet enrollment targets. This could require extending the enrollment period, reducing the expectation of enrollment by the first quartile, or moving the First Subject Enrolled date to a later date. Alternatively, this could suggest that the study would benefit from the addition of sites in locations with shorter MOH/FDA delays.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>ClearTrial displays the First Site Approved date (FSA) per location based on the number of sites in that location and the expected regulatory delay.</p>

<p>ClearTrial calculates and displays the number of sites to which the percentage applies.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <span class="bold">Percent of sites identified by sponsor</span> may apply to sites that were used in previous studies or that the sponsor has a special relationship with. The cost of identifying these sites is assigned to the sponsor rather than to the vendor responsible for obtaining all of the regulatory documents and approving the sites.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Site visits add a significant cost to your plan. You can specify the percentage of the sites that require in-person visits versus phone-based visits.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Pre-study visits</span>&mdash;If a site was used within the last year, by either the sponsor or the monitoring vendor, it usually does not need a pre-study site visit. Refer to your own SOPs regarding pre-study visits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Site-initiation visits</span>&mdash;This is normally equal to or less than the number of sites expected to participate in the study. On rare occasions, the study project manager might allow additional sites to be initiated (as back-ups) but, generally, will not approve the drug to be shipped unless the plan is to activate the sites later in the enrollment period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Close-out visits</span>&mdash;Normally, all sites participating in the study need a close-out visit when all subjects have completed the study. Therefore, the default for the field is 100%. However, there are some studies where this does not apply. For example, in Phase IV trials not done under an IND, it may not be necessary to close out the sites. In that case, the value for onsite close-out visits is 0%.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clinical sites are paid based on certain milestones, subjects enrolled, data collected, and so on. In the <span class="bold">Number of grant payments per site</span> field, determine the number of payments to be made to investigators (average) over the course of the study. This value assumes quarterly payments (4), but you can override tis value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Local monitoring</span> refers to sites assigned to monitors that work in the same city as the investigators. These sites do not require overnight travel or lengthy travel time to and from the site (generally less than 30 minutes each way).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many sites require an <span class="bold">overhead</span> beyond the standard investigator grant. For example, university sites and other independent sites without university affiliations might require overhead. If you have not included this in the investigator grant amount on the Locations tab, specify the percentage of sites that require this additional overhead. For example, if you entered an investigator grant of $10,000 with 50% overhead at 4 of 10 sites requiring overhead and 25% overhead at the remaining 6 sites, the percentage is 35%.</p>

<p>In the <span class="bold">Define the Enrollment Period</span> section, define the relationship between the Project Activity Start Date and the First Subject In (FSI) date.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For studies that are outsourced (in whole or in part), the <span class="bold">Project Activity Start Date</span> <span class="bold">(PASD)</span> is the date on which a service provider begins billable work on the project. You selected this date on the Overview tab. For studies conducted internally by the sponsor, the Project Activity Start Date is the date on which project initiation activities begin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <span class="bold">First Subject In date (FSI/FPI)</span> value is the date that the First Subject First Visit (FSFV) is expected to take place. ClearTrial estimates this date based on the study site approval schedule. However, you can override the suggested value with any date later than the Project Activity Start Date.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you change the Project Activity Start Date after this section has been completed and saved, the following might have to be addressed:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you or another user accepted the default First Subject In (FSI) date, ClearTrial updates this date according to the changed Project Activity Start Date.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you or another user changed the FSI date, any change in the Project Activity Start Date updates the FSI date that was entered. You must revisit and revise any dates that have been overridden.If you select a start date that is greater than the user-specified FSI date, a warning appears in the FSI date indicating that the date is before the Project Activity Start Date.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>In the <span class="bold">Screening and Drops</span> section, the <span class="bold">Subjects to randomize</span> field displays the number of subjects expected in the selected location or for all locations. You can specify a percentage of the total subjects randomized to be screened as alternate subjects and a stipend to pay to alternate subjects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the <span class="bold">Screen failure rate</span> field, enter the percentage of screened subjects expected to fail to become study participants.</p>
<p>For example, if one out of every five potential subjects is expected to fail the screening, the screen failure rate is 20%. If the number of subjects to randomize is 100, the number of subjects to screen is 125. This value cannot be greater than 99.99%. We recommend entering a value between 0% and 50%. The calculation for this field is as follows:</p>
<p>Number Of Screen Failures Expected = Number of Subjects to be Randomized / (100 - Percent of Subjects that Fail Screen).</p>
<p>For example, if the protocol requires 100 subjects to be randomized, and it is expected that for every four subjects screened, one will fail, the screen failure rate is 25%. You would need to screen at least 133 subjects. 33 screen failures = 100 subjects to randomize / 133 * 0.25.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the <span class="bold">Subject drop rate</span> field, indicate the percent of subjects you expect to not complete a full CRF due to early termination. ClearTrial uses this percentage as it calculates the data that needs to be monitored and entered into the database.</p>
<p>For example, if you expect only three out of four subjects randomized to complete the study, the drop rate is 25%. If 100 subjects are randomized and you expect a 25% drop rate, only 75 subjects are expected to complete the study. Sponsors likely do not have a schedule developed during the bidding or budgeting phase, so ClearTrial estimates 75% of the costs will be incurred for dropped subjects. These are pass-through costs and can only be estimated. However, you can easily adjust these costs if more exact amounts are known.</p>

You can specify per-location assumptions for the selected treatment, customize the treatment schedule, and record notes relevant to the treatment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Define the treatment parameters.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Treatment duration</span>&mdash;For each subject, enter the treatment period length (time-on-trial). For Phase 1 (Healthy Volunteers) trials, the treatment duration is modeled in days. For all late-stage trials, the default is weeks but you have the option to model the treatment period in days. ClearTrial allows you to model a minimum of one day or one week for the treatment duration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Visits per subject</span>&mdash;Specify the number of visits for each subject during the treatment. For Phase 1 (Healthy Volunteers) trials, since you are modeling in days, a visit is assumed to be on the day of treatment. A visit is a day for which one or more CRF pages are generated or collected. For late-stage trials, it is assumed there is a visit per day of the week; therefore, one week has seven visits. For example, if you are modeling a trial in which patients are seen twice a week, add the number of pages collected at each of the two visits into a single visit in the treatment schedule.</p>
<p>For Phase 1 (Healthy Volunteers) studies, in which subjects are confined and procedures are performed throughout the day on most or all days of treatment or washout, each day is a visit for the purposes of the ClearTrial planning algorithms.</p>
<p>If your study has multiple visits per week, specify the duration of the treatment period in days. This allows CRO users to enter the actual number of visits so that the bid matches the RFP. Otherwise visits occurring in the same week are combined into a single visit. If the number of visits is greater than the number of weeks, you will see a warning. Make sure you are planning in days and not weeks for this specific scenario.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Number of bednights</span>&mdash;For Phase 1 (Healthy Volunteers) trials, specify the number of nights subjects will be confined to the CPU during the treatment. ClearTrial uses this value to calculate pass-through costs associated with non-procedural services provided (for example, room, meals, and entertainment). If subjects are also confined during the washout period(s), specify the number of bednights during washout separately.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">CRF pages per subject</span>&mdash;Specify the number of Case Report Form (CRF) pages to be collected for each subject during this treatment. This value should include quality-of-life (QOL), pharmacoeconomic, and subject diary pages collected. ClearTrial considers the Number of CRF Pages Per Subject, the treatment period, the enrollment period, subject visits, and other factors to estimate the treatment schedule. Baseline visits and final visits are estimated differently than interim visits. ClearTrial calculates interim visits based on the average number of pages remaining and spread evenly throughout the first to last subject visit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">QOL pages</span>&mdash;Specify how many of the pages collected during the treatment period are Quality of Life (QOL) pages, reviewed to see if they have been filled out by the study subjects. These usually require little or no monitoring.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Subject diary pages</span>&mdash;Specify how many of the pages collected during the treatment period are subject diary pages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Pharmacoeconomic pages</span>&mdash;Specify how many of the pages collected during the treatment period are pharmacoeconomic pages. These pages are reviewed to see if they have been filled out by the study subjects, but usually require little or no monitoring.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Lab and diagnostic tests per subject</span>&mdash;Specify the number of expected lab and diagnostic tests per subject per treatment arm. This field is only available in cost models 5.5 above.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Cohort escalation reviews</span>&mdash;Specify the number of dose escalation reviews per treatment arm. This field is only available in cost models 5.5 above.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Monitoring minutes per CRF page</span>&mdash;Specify the number of minutes to monitor one regular CRF page. If a study is complex, or you want the monitors to spend extra time onsite performing additional activities, increase the monitoring time. This field does not apply to monitoring pages generated during the baseline visit. ClearTrial calculates the default value based on the chosen phase and therapeutic indication of the study. You can override this value for each treatment arm. Overridden values do not affect minute-per-page values for the baseline visit or washout period for a crossover study.</p>
<p>The default or user-defined monitoring minutes per CRF page applies to both the treatment and extended treatment period for the treatment arm.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>For endpoint studies, define the extended treatment parameters.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Average CRF pages per extended visit&mdash;Specify the average number of CRFs that will be collected during each visit after a subject has completed the standard treatment. This value should include quality-of-life (QOL), pharmacoeconomic, and subject diary pages collected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>QOL pages per extended visit&mdash;Specify how many of the pages collected during the extended treatment period are Quality of Life (QOL) pages.</p>

ClearTrial calculates associated direct labor fees and indirect costs based on the selected EDC maturity level you select from the <span class="bold">EDC Maturity Level</span> drop-down list. This is the default data collection method.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">EDC-3rd Party</span>&mdash;Select this choice if you do not want ClearTrial to calculate labor fees related to EDC, but instead want to create or adjust pass-through costs to account for these expenditures. Use this option if none of the service providers added to this plan are responsible for EDC management. You can include and assign individual tasks that are excluded by default for EDC 3rd Party on the Assignment tab.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Investigator Site Data Entry</span>&mdash;Data will be keyed into a data capture system or web-based system by someone at the site. This option is not the same as EDC.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Faxed CRFs</span>&mdash;CRFs will be faxed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In step 2, if you selected Electronic Data Capture or EDC-3rd Party, from the <span class="bold">EDC Maturity Level</span> drop-down list select the stage to apply to the plan. This drop-down list doesn't appear in Quick mode.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Stage 1: Pilot/Single Study</span>&mdash;You are actively conducting experimental EDC implementations within a single study or within a very limited number of clinical trials. The primary goal in conducting pilot or single-study EDC implementations is to identify the possible benefits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Stage 2: Limited Standardization</span>&mdash;You have moved past piloting EDC and have recognized its potential value. Stage 2 tests EDC abilities to full scale and assesses reliability. EDC deployment is typically expanded to other trial phases or different therapeutic areas during this stage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Stage 3: Standardization</span>&mdash;You have an established standardization for EDC on all new trials over all phases and therapeutic areas. Most clinical trials using paper are doing so only because they began prior to initial EDC implementation and are grand-fathered until they conclude. There is a high level of integration between EDC and other systems such as CTMS, laboratory systems, project management systems, payment systems, and IVRS. During this stage, companies commit to a preferred EDC solution vendor and entertain discussions about forming long-term partnerships with vendors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Stage 4: Enterprise Deployment</span>&mdash;You have an established enterprise-wide standardization on a single integrated EDC solution and all clinical management systems are fully integrated with the EDC system. EDC solutions found in Stage 4 provide hybrid paper/electronic features that support a limited number of paper records. All note taking is done directly in the system, and all signatures are recorded electronically. A small number of clinical trials, or certain portions of a trial, might still require the use of paper.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the <span class="bold">Query Rate</span> field, specify as a percentage the average number of queries expected per every 100 pages of CRF data.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you are planning a single treatment arm trial and have estimated in terms of queries per CRF book instead, enter the value obtained by the following conversion:</p>
<p>(Number of Queries per CRF Book / Number of Pages in the CRF Book) * 100</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the <span class="bold">Percent of database data to audit</span> field, indicate the percent of the database information that must be audited.</p>
<p>Typically, the vendor who manages the data is required to audit some percentage of the database. The default for this value is 10%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the <span class="bold">Minutes for Data Entry per CRF page</span> field, ClearTrial displays the number of minutes required to enter one CRF page into the database, assuming double data entry. ClearTrial calculates this value based on the phase and therapeutic indication of the study. You can override this value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the <span class="bold">Minutes for Data Coordination per CRF page</span> field, ClearTrial displays the number of minutes required to coordinate CRF data and calculates this value based on the phase and therapeutic indication of the study. You can override this value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From time to time the vendor who manages the data must transfer the data in electronic format to the sponsor. This can be done at the end of the study or periodically throughout the study. In the <span class="bold">Total number of data transfers</span> field, enter the number of data transfers to be performed. If the sponsor is performing data management, enter 0.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the <span class="bold">Number of interim analyses to be performed</span> field, specify the number of interim analyses to be performed. The default value is 0 and we recommend that the value should not be greater than 3.</p>
<p>An interim analysis is a preliminary look at the study data to determine if there are large differences between treatment groups. Interim analysis can be planned for specified calendar times (for example, quarterly) or when specific numbers of subjects have enrolled in the study to ensure that a sufficient amount of data is available for review.</p>
<p>Interim analysis typically requires a dedicated monitoring trip at the end of this period to collect data so that the data can be entered into the database and the interim analysis performed. We recommend that you adjust the monitoring schedule if an interim analysis is required for your study.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the <span class="bold">Number of 3rd party vendors/data sources</span> field, specify the number of third-party vendors or data sources used to capture study-related data. These vendors or sources are those, other than the CRO, whose data need to be imported or otherwise collected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the <span class="bold">Total number of data imports from 3rd party vendors</span> field, specify the total number of imports from third-party vendors expected throughout the study. This is the total number of imports, not the number expected per third-party vendor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the <span class="bold">CRF Design</span> section, specify the number of Case Report Form (CRF) pages that are not duplicates of another CRF page or screen.</p>
<p>For example, the same AE page that is required at each visit counts as one unique page. The minimum field value is 1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Define the <span class="bold">number of screens per CRF page</span>. This is the number of screens needed to capture one paper CRF page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the <span class="bold">Biostatistics</span> section, enter biostatistical study assumptions.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the <span class="bold">Biostatistics</span> section, enter the number of unique and repeat data tables, listings, and figures and graphs for the study.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If your study is a Phase 1, Healthy Volunteers trial, complete the Unique and Repeat PK/PD sections.</p>
<p>ClearTrial displays a default setting for these fields based on the number of CRF unique pages specified. You can override the estimates.</p>

<li>
<p><span class="bold">Percentage of time monitors spend in the field</span>&mdash;ClearTrial assumes that monitors spend the remainder of their time on site management activities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Percentage of monitoring done by CRAs (vs. Senior CRAs)</span>&mdash;In complex studies, you might prefer that a Senior CRA perform a larger percentage of the monitoring. If this is the case, decrease the percentage to indicate that less of the monitoring will be done by CRAs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Percentage of monitoring done by Regional Monitors</span>&mdash;Even when 100% of monitoring is done by Regional Monitors, some site management activities are performed by CRAs or SCRAs. When using Regional Monitors, time allocated for travel is assigned to monitored CRF and site management tasks.</p>

<p>In the <span class="bold">Monitored Data</span> section, enter the following details.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Total CRF pages generated (without subject drops)&mdash;</span>Displays the predicted CRF pages that will be monitored, accounting for subjects that drop out of the study. ClearTrial derives this value from the subject drop rate, which is applied to each week of the study to calculate the subject retention rate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Total CRF pages monitored (accounting for subject drops)</span>&mdash;Displays the predicted CRF pages that will be monitored, accounting for subjects that drop out of the study. ClearTrial derives this value from the subject drop rate, which is applied to each week of the study to calculate the subject retention rate.</p>
<p>To determine the number of total CRFs for a study, including a correction for dropped subjects, ClearTrial does the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For the first two weeks of enrollment, ClearTrial assumes that no subjects drop. Retention for weeks 1 and 2 is 100% and all scheduled CRFS are completed. ClearTrial assumes the drop rate is linear and calculates the weekly reduction rate as the overall drop rate divided by the number of weeks after week 2.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ClearTrial takes the number of CRFs that would have been generated each week if no subjects had dropped and multiplies it by the retention rate percentages to calculate the CRFs including drop out.</p>
<p>You can increase or decrease this value. The percentage change of your adjustment is applied to the CRF pages generated during each week of treatment to produce the total number of CRF pages, including drop outs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For each week after week 2 of enrollment (for example, the total enrollment period minus the first two weeks), ClearTrial starts correcting the total number of CRFs completed by the drop rate.</p>

<p>ClearTrial supports two types of service providers: Sponsors and Contract Research Organizations (CROs). There are four types of CROs:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Premium</span>&mdash;Provide a global presence in all major regions. You can fully outsource studies to them, but premium CROs are more expensive than other CRO types.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Major</span>&mdash;Provide a global presence in all major regions. You can fully outsource studies to them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Medium</span>&mdash;Provide an incomplete global presence. You can fully outsource studies to them, but they may have to sub-contract some of the work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Niche</span>&mdash;Operate in only one country or region and often offer only a subset of services.</p>

<p>In the <span class="bold">Billing Rate Information</span> section, accept or override the default billing rate settings for the provider:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Rate Year in effect</span>&mdash;Specify which set of billing rats to use to calculate the provider's fees. ClearTrial uses the hourly rates published for this provider for the rate chosen as the base rate, plus or minus any discount indicated here, then applies the specified inflation percentages over the course of the study.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Discount rate to apply to this study</span>&mdash;Specify any negotiated percentage discount established with this provider.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Back-Office Billing Rate Location</span>&mdash;Specify the location where centralized or regionalized tasks or functions are performed. ClearTrial uses this location to calculate fees based on the billing rates associated with resources in this location. When you edit the detailed assignments on the Assignment tab, you can choose another location for one or more centralized tasks if necessary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Bottom Line Discount</span>&mdash;Specify any negotiated monetary discount established with this provider for the plan. This discount is only applied to the provider's labor fees. Select the currency in which to calculate the discount from the drop-down list. If there is more than one provider for a plan, each could offer a different discount.</p>
</li>

<p>In the <span class="bold">FTE Utilization Information</span> section, override the percentages in the <span class="bold">Project Manager utilization prior/after FSI/FPI</span> fields.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>ClearTrial suggests percentages of project manager resources prior to and after a first-subject-in date. These values are not calculated until after all study tasks have been assigned on the Assignment tab.</p>
<p>These values change whenever certain assumptions are modified, including the number of sites or locations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We recommend that you review the values if the number of sites or locations change or if tasks are reassigned.</p>
<p>For example, if you know that one full-time project manager will be allocated to the project before the date the first subject is enrolled, then you should enter 100% in the utilization prior field. If two full-time project managers are needed during this period, enter 200%. If a project manager will spend only half time on this study during the period, enter 50%.</p>

<div class="infobox-note">
<p class="notep1">Note:</p>
Do not modify this factor without a full understanding of how it will affect the plan</div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Use this field only to allow comparison of the cost and time for a sponsor to conduct a study (or subset of study tasks) versus a CRO to conduct a study or perform certain tasks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This field indicates the percentage of time, on average, that this service provider or sponsor team is working on the project, as a percentage of their overall workday.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For CROs, the recommended value is 80%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For sponsors, the recommended values are between 50 and 70%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you decrease this percentage, you are indicating that this service provider requires more hours to complete a task than a service provider with a higher allocation. For example, if a sponsor's employees are dedicated to the project 70% of the time and spend only 30% of their time on other company activities, including meetings, conferences, vacation, sick, time, or other duties, then enter 70% in this field for the sponsor.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>To see and assign individual tasks, click the blue triangle to the left of the assignment group.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <span class="bold">Included</span> column indicates whether this task is included in the study and, in some cases, allows you to exclude a task from the study. If this checkbox is grayed out, the task must be included (or excluded) from the plan based on other input assumptions you have made or other study characteristics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can exclude selected tasks from the plan, which eliminates the effort and costs associated with these tasks. Tasks that cannot be excluded or specifically assigned, or whose billing rate location cannot be different from the location of subject data, are presented with the associated option(s) disabled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If, on the Overview tab, you selected <span class="bold">Outsourced</span>, you can only assign tasks to a Vendor. If you selected <span class="bold">Conducted Internally</span>, you can only assign tasks to the Sponsor.

</li>
<li>
<p>For each <span class="bold">Assignment Group/Task</span>, from the <span class="bold">Assign to</span> drop-down list, select the service provider.</p>
<p>The value displayed might indicate additional information when showing the assigned provider(s) for an entire group of tasks, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Service provider name appears with no additional markers</span>&mdash;All tasks in the group are performed by a single service provider.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Service provider name appears with an asterisk (*)</span>&mdash;The service provider is the default service provider selected to perform tasks in the group.</p>

<p>From the <span class="bold">Billing Rate Location</span> drop-down list, select the billing rate location to use to calculate resource costs for this task or group of tasks.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can specify a different billing rate location for each group or task. For example, if data management tasks for all European sites are performed in Germany, change this field to Germany for each of the locations in Europe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can select any location where this activity or activities are conducted. The location does not need to have active sites participating in the study. For example, you might have study sites in France, Germany, and Italy, but perform all data management in the UK or India.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To choose a location that does not have sites or subjects, from the drop-down list, choose <span class="bold">Other...</span>. Choose the location where the work is performed and click <span class="bold">Ok</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By default, centralized tasks are calculated using the back office billing rate selected on the Provider tab.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>To prevent cascading changes, pin the service provider and billing rate location assignments by clicking the <span class="bold">Pushpin icon</span> in the <span class="bold">Pinned</span> column to highlight it.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If an assigned provider has been deleted from the plan, the task assignment changes to the primary provider in the plan. Any changes to tasks are pinned by default.</p>
<p>For example, if assignments made for individual tasks included in the group are not pinned, changes made to the assignment group or to the location defaults override these assignments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pinned settings are lost if you remove the associated locations or service providers from the plan. However, if you replace a provider, your pinned settings are maintained.</p>

<p>A Major Task is a collection of related tasks that share the same unit of measure, labor scope, and expected distribution of units completed.</p>
<p>By default, the Major Tasks you add appear below the ClearTrial-defined Major Tasks in the order you create them. However, you can specify where to display them. See . ClearTrial applies inflation to all Major Tasks, whether user-defined or ClearTrial-defined, based on inflation settings on the Provider tab.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>On the <span class="bold">Labor</span> tab, click <span class="bold">New Major Task</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the <span class="bold">Task Manager,</span> on the <span class="bold">Major Task Details</span> tab, define the basic attributes of the new Major Task.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Name</span>&mdash;We recommend naming the Major Task with the explicit deliverable or unit of work expected. Major Task names must be unique within a plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Description</span>&mdash;We recommend providing a description to help others understand the purpose of the Major Task.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Labor</span>&mdash;Specify whether associated tasks are location-scoped or study-scoped.</p>
<p>Tasks that are performed locally, such as monitoring or other site visits, are location-scoped and are usually measured in terms of the number of sites or visits in each location. Location-scoped tasks can be assigned to different service providers in different locations. For a location-scoped task, you can create different algorithms to determine the level of effort required to complete the task in that location.</p>
<p>Study-scoped tasks can be assigned to only one service provider. Tasks that are performed as part of project initiation or as part of back-office operations are usually study-scoped and the only relevant unit of measure is the study itself.</p>
<div class="infobox-note">
<p class="notep1">Note:</p>
Labor scope cannot be changed for Major Tasks defined in the prior forecast when creating a reforecast.</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Unit of Measure</span>&mdash;From the drop-down list, select the unit of work this Major Task represents. Both ClearTrial default and user-defined units of work are listed. ClearTrial calculates all effort for associated tasks in terms of hours to complete one such unit.</p>
<p>For example, a Major Task whose unit of measure is Sites Approved is composed of tasks whose resources level of effort are calculated as the number of hours required to approve one site. This level of effort (or LOE) represents the unit hours for the resource for the task.</p>
<p>The ClearTrial-calculated unit hours are multiplied by the number of units expected (for example, number of sites approved) to produce the Extended Unit Hours.</p>
<p>User-defined units of work appear in the drop-down list in italicized type followed by an asterisk.</p>

<p>On the <span class="bold">Rates &amp; Substitutions</span> tab, you can assign the billing rate location for the selected resource when working on this task and override the billing rates for the selected resource when performing the task.</p>
<p>Each row displays the hourly billing rate for the selected resource based on its billing rate location.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>From the <span class="bold">Billing Rate Location</span> drop-down, select the location where this activity will be performed.</p>
<p>It is not necessary for the location to have active sites participating in the study. For example, you might have study sites in France, Germany, and Italy but perform all data management in the UK or India.</p>
<p>By default, ClearTrial calculates centralized tasks using the back office billing rate of the assigned provider.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the task is location-scoped, you can override the value in the <span class="bold">Rate</span> field for each location.</p>
<p>You can override the standard billing rate on a case-by-case basis. For example, a Medical Director might have a billing rate of $300.00 per hour. For a specific task, he or she bills at $500.00 per hour. If you enter $500.00 in the rate field for this task, the application uses the $500.00 per hour rate. All other tasks are calculated at $300.00 per hour.</p>
<p>If you have overridden the billing rate location, the rate displayed reflects that choice rather than the local rate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can select a resource to substitute from the <span class="bold">Substitute</span> drop-down.</p>
<p>By default the billing rate used is the effective billing rate, which can be overridden at the plan level or plan-location level of the selected resource. If resource substitutions have also been made at the plan level or plan-location level for the assigned service provider, the default effective billing rate is defined as the rate for the selected resource when performing the work of the original resource.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can use the <span class="bold">% Adjust</span> field to specify a percentage adjustment to the rate for a selected resource on a case-by-case basis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To prevent cascading changes, pin the billing rate location assignment, substitute resource, and billing rate by clicking the <span class="bold">Pushpin icon</span> in the <span class="bold">Pinned</span> column to highlight it.</p>
<p>Changes made to the billing rate location for the task or task group assignments will not override pinned billing rate locations for this resource for this task. Also, changes made to the billing rate or resource at the plan level or plan-location level will not override pinned billing rates or substitutions for this resource for this task. However, pinned settings will be lost if the associated location and/or service provider are removed from the plan.</p>

For details on using the scripting language, see <a href="customizingyourplan.htm#BAJFGEEI">Customize resources and costs with expressions and scripting</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can create algorithms with up to eight individual expressions. Each expression within the algorithm has the ability to use a different cost driver, percentage to apply to the cost driver and monetary value.</p>
<p>When working with multi-expressions, enter a per unit cost, currency, cost driver, and percentage to apply to the cost driver to evaluate to a specific monetary value in a specific currency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you have specified the cost as location-scoped, then you can define an algorithm for each location.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When working with expert algorithms, the scripting language is used to define mathematical formulas to calculate the monetary value of the cost item. Expert algorithms should only be used if you are unable to produce the right cost value using multi-expressions.</p>

<div id="CTPAN242" class="sect3"><!-- infolevel="all" infotype="General" --><a id="sthref68"></a>
<h4 class="sect3">FTE calculation</h4>
<p>ClearTrial calculates the FTE for a functional area based on the total resource hours, total study duration (in days), and number of full-time hours for one year required to complete the work.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>For example, if service providers in a functional area (such as Data Management) work 109,887 hours through a study duration of 2,490 days, the FTE equivalent is 0.9 FTEs or [109,887/(2,490 days/365.25)]/1,800 = 0.9.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ClearTrial also calculates the FTE for resources. For example, if a resource works 6,998 hours over a study duration of 568 days, the FTE equivalent is 2.5 FTEs or [(6,998 total hours)/(568/365.25)]/1,800 = 2.5.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>View the resulting monthly budgets, resource requirements, cycle times, and milestones across a group of studies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Account for the likelihood that a plan will come to fruition by discounting the costs associated with the plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make on-the-fly adjustments and see the immediate impacts on budgets and resource requirements.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can exclude plans from a portfolio to see how the exclusion affects the overall fees, costs, and hours of a portfolio. When you exclude a plan from the portfolio, it remains listed in the portfolio with a line through it and it can be included again.</p>

<p>To adjust the start date forward (earlier), enter a negative number.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To postpone a plan, enter a positive number.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This feature does not make adjustments for inflation. This is because the billing rate year associated with a plan does not change when you use Start Offset.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the <span class="bold">Probability</span> field, you can specify the probability of a plan being implemented. ClearTrial reduces the costs associated with the plan according to the percentage. For example, if you set the probability to 50%, ClearTrial adds half of the plan's costs to the portfolio. The plan itself is not affected.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click <span class="bold">Save</span>, then <span class="bold">Next</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the <span class="bold">Summary</span> tab, review the portfolio dashboard.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can adjust the time frame by constraining the start and end dates, and you can include or exclude particular plans. The Summary tab reflects only costs and hours from included plans. Costs and hours from excluded plans are not added to the costs and hours of the portfolio.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If any of the included plans has a probability of less than 100%, the costs and hours are reduced accordingly. For example, if you set probability to 50%, the costs and hours shown reflect only half of the costs and hours.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If any of the included plans have an offset start date, the costs and hours associated with the plan begin on the offset date, not on the original start date of the plan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Cost Distribution graph provides a view of when costs occur over the time range specified. The shaded blue area represents the time frame you selected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the Portfolio Fees, Hours, and Pass-Through Costs section, if inflation and/or bottom line discount exist in the plans included in the portfolio, inflation and bottom line discounts appear as separate line items.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click <span class="bold">Next</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the <span class="bold">Reports</span> tab, you can generate additional reports about the portfolio.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can view each report in a separate window, print it, export it to Microsoft Excel, or convert it to PDF.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The reports reflect only costs and hours from included plans. Costs and hours from excluded plans are not added to the costs and hours of the portfolio and, therefore, do not appear in reports.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If any of the included plans have a probability of less than 100%, the costs and hours are reduced accordingly. For example, if you set probability to 50%, the costs and hours reflect only half of the plan's costs and hours. If any of the included plans has an offset start date, the costs and hours associated with the plan begin on the offset date, not on the original start date.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select a report, specify any details, and click <span class="bold">OK</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you are finished with the report, click <span class="bold">Close</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click <span class="bold">Close</span>.</p>
