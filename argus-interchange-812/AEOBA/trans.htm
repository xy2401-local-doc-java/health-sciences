<h2 class="sect1">Scheduling Reports</h2>
<p>Argus Safety enables you to schedule your E2B, eMDR and eVAERS reports. In addition, it allows you to generate these reports that comply with the adverse event reporting requirements of different regulatory agencies.</p>
<div class="infobox-note">
<p class="notep1">Note:</p>
When you generate an E2B report, some characters entered by the user in the case form may not be display in the same way in the E2B report. Some characters are represented differently in the E2B report such as &amp;amp; for (&amp;), &amp;lt; for (&lt;), &amp;gt; for (&gt;), &amp;apos; for (') and &amp;quot; for (") as per XML specifications.</div>
<p>To schedule an E2B report:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Open a case in Argus Safety and click the Regulatory Reports tab.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the system opens the Regulatory Reports tab, click Schedule New Report.</p>

<p>When you accept a Nullification report, the system creates an Action Item in the case. The action item tells you that the system will delete the case if you click OK on the acceptance Dialog for all unarchived cases.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Action Item is a type-ahead field and its default is blank.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The field is populated with values from the action item configured in the code List.</p>

<li>
<p>You can assign the number of days until the action item is due in the Due In field. The system enables this field after you select an Action Item type.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The system calculates the due date as follows: System Date (local client date) + Due In number of days.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The system puts the System Date (local client date) in the Date field.</p>

<p>When creating the action item, you can select a value from the Code List and the Action Item Description. The system uses the following format: Nullification: xxx</p>
<p>where:</p>
<p>xxx is the value entered in the Notes field.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By default, the system assigns the action item to the user group in the User Group field.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There can be a maximum of 25 user groups in the drop-down list.</p>
</li>

<h3 class="sect2">Follow-Up eMDR Reports</h3>
<p>If an eMDR report is manually scheduled or automatically scheduled for the same reporting Destination, system either schedules Initial or Follow-up report based on the same logic (product license ID and status of previously scheduled report) that is currently existing for Device reports.</p>
<p>If the case was previously submitted to a Reporting Destination as MedWatch Device report and if the same reporting destination is configured for sending eMDR report:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>System schedules the next eMDR as a follow-up report and displays the follow-up numbering in the Case Form ' Regulatory Reports ' Seq field by considering the previously reported MedWatch device report.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>System uses the same report number (F.2 or G.9) that was used in MedWatch Device report in eMDR for the data element ufimporterrepnumber(F2) or mfrreportnumber (G9).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Follow-up number that is populated in (F7 uffollowupnumber or G7 gfollowupnumber) shall be incremented from (F7 or G7) of the previously submitted MedWatch Device report by considering the internal common profile switch <span class="italic">Allow generation of Report</span>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Example : If F/p 1 report was submitted as 0000555-2014-00011 to CDRH in MedWatch format and the next follow-up report in eMDR format, then Mfr Report # shall be populated as 0000555-2014-00011 and F/p number as 2.</p>
<p>If the previous report was sent by eMDR and the subsequent report is being sent as MedWatch Device to the same destination, the system shall maintain the report numbering (F2 or G9) same as of previously submitted eMDR.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>System schedules a follow-up report by populating <span class="italic">Follow-up' in the Case Form</span> Regulatory Reports' Seq column.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>System uses the same report number (F2 or G9) from the previously submitted eMDR report in the F2 or G9 of MedWatch Device report.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Follow-up number that is populated in (F7 or G7) is incremented from (F7 uffollowupnumber or G7 gfollowupnumber) of the previously submitted eMDR report by considering the internal common profile switch <span class="italic">Allow generation of Report</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The MedWatch Device scheduled after the eMDR report does not respect the Common Profile Switch "<span class="italic">Data to print on follow up MedWatch Device form</span> "and system displays a warning message during manual scheduling of report as <span class="italic">Delta data will not be printed MedWatch Device form for this Device license as it was previously submitted as an eMDR</span>. In case automatic scheduling, this warning message is logged against the report without impacting report scheduling or generation.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Example : If F/p 1 report was submitted as 0000555-2014-00011 to CDRH in eMDR format and the next follow-up report in eMDR report fails due to some reason and company decides to send them in MedWatch device format, then MedWatch report shall print Mfr Report # as 0000555-2014-00011 and F/p number as 2</p>

<p>If an eVAERS report is manually scheduled or automatically scheduled for the same reporting Destination, system either schedules Initial or Follow-up report based on the same logic (product license type and status of previously scheduled report) that is currently existing for E2B reports.</p>
<p>If the case was previously submitted to a Reporting Destination in VAERS PDF format and if the same reporting destination is configured for sending eVAERS report:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>System schedules the next eVAERS as a follow-up report and displays the follow-up numbering in the Case Form ' Regulatory Reports ' Seq field by considering the previously reported VAERS.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If any Follow-up reports are scheduled to the same destination at a later point of time, system schedules a follow-up report by populating'<span class="italic">Follow-up&lt;##&gt; in Case Form</span> Regulatory Reports Seq column.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>System uses Case Number (as printed in the Manufacturer Control Number (that is listed in Box 24) of the previously submitted VAERS report) in data elements C.1.1. and C.1.8.1.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If a reporting destination is configured for eVAERS and VAERS reports and if the previous report was sent in eVAERS format and if the subsequent report is scheduled in VAERS PDF format to the same destination:</p>

<h2 class="sect1">Generating Reports</h2>
<p>Use the following procedure to generate a scheduled report.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>E2B, eMDR and eVAERS report scan be manually generated by clicking the draft/final links in the row that corresponds to the scheduled E2B Report in In the Regulatory Reports tab. The report is generated and can be viewed in the ICSR Viewer. If a validation error occurs during E2B report generation, the validation details are stored in the Report Details Dialog.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>E2B, eMDR and eVAERS reports are generated by AG Services for a locked case which has scheduled E2B report.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="infobox-note">
<p class="notep1">Note:</p>
The system allows you to generate E2B reports through AG Service irrespective of the your access rights for blinded information. However, the Blind protected users are not allowed to view E2B reports despite having an Argus Interchange license. If such a user tries to view the E2B report, the system generates the message: <span class="italic">Report is generated but system is unable to show the report as user is protected from study information</span>.</div>

<h2 class="sect1">Attachments in Reports</h2>
<p>Case Form Attachments are sent to Reporting Destination with the E2B (R2) report as described below:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If attachment classification in the case is specified in the Reporting Destination, system reads such Attachments and converts .XLS, .TXT, .TIF, .DOC, .RTF, .PNG, .JPG or .BMP them into PDF and combine with the PDF attachments if any in the case.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The single merged PDF has each attachment which is merged available as a link (bookmark) by the classification name provided for the attached file.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attachments are sent only if there is a E2B report sent out for that Agency. Attachments are not sent for nullification reports.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="infobox-note">
<p class="notep1">Note:</p>
While transmitting attachments using the FDA profile in the E2B (R2) format, the system places the attachment file (PDF file created by merging all relevant attachments) in the configured Attachment folder (<span class="bold">Reporting Destination</span> &gt; <span class="bold">EDI tab</span> &gt; <span class="bold">ICSR Attachment Outgoing folder</span>) only after receiving a positive ACK for the ICSR submitted in the E2B (R2) format as an Initial or Follow-up report.
<p>The placement of Attachment files in configured folder after receipt of Positive Ack is done only for E2B (R2) generated using FDA E2B (R2) profile (CFG_PROFILE.AUTHORITY_ID=2.</p>
<p>The system retains the ICSR Attachment in the Outgoing folder if a negative acknowledge is received for an ICSR.</p>
</div>
<p>Case Form Attachments are sent to the Reporting Destination with E2B (R3) report as described below:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Case Form Attachments are embedded within the ICSR sent in report formats such as E2B (R3), eVAERS and eMDR.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attachments are encoded in the B64 format and sent in the report. The selection of attachments is based on Reporting Destination configuration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attachments for E2B(R3) are compressed using the compression algorithm configured before embedding them to ICSR. The default algorithm used is DF (Deflate). Attachments are not compressed in eVAERS and eMDR reports.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attachments that were sent out in previous submissions are not sent in Follow-up submission of E2B (R3), eVAERS and eMDR reports (only new and updated attachments are sent in Follow-up reports).</p>

<h4 class="sect3">Validation Check of Incoming Message</h4>
<p>Prior to updating the transmission status of the reports, the application identifies the type of incoming message and validates the incoming message. The ICSR service processes all the incoming messages located in a folder either in incoming EDI directory or physical media directory. Incoming ICSR Messages are retrieved as SGML from a shared directory. The incoming folder is configurable in Argus Interchange Mapping Utility. ICSR message is parsed to check the validity of the SGML file using the correct version of DTD. The incoming message is saved after checking that message is in compliance with DTD.</p>
<p>The recipient of the ICSR message acknowledges receipt of message and notifies the sender about the validity and usability of the data in the reports. The acknowledgment message is called as ICSR Acknowledgment Message. When a message is acknowledged, workflow status of the ICSR report is updated with one of the following three status:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>All reports loaded into recipient database</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ICSR Error, not all reports loaded into database</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SGML parsing error no data extracted</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The acknowledgement contains two sections, one concerning the validity of the message as a whole and the second containing comments on the validity of the individual reports within the message. Create a folder and configure it through the Argus Interchange Mapping Utility, where all the incoming messages can be stored. The Interchange service processes the received message and moves it in the Archive folder.</p>
<p>The message is validated based on the ICH ICSR acknowledgement specifications and the format of the message identified by DTD version. Correctness of receiver and sender identifier present in the message header is also validated to verify that the message is not sent to the wrong recipient.</p>
<p>The content of the message is validated based on the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Required Data</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data Type</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Data Length</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Field Value</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The system identifies message type (acknowledgement) and the DTD version of the message. If the application is unable to identify the message type or DTD version, then the error is logged in the log table and further processing is stopped. The application sends an email to configured email address indicating the failure to read the message.</p>
<p>Application checks for the presence of the duplicate in the system based on the &amp;rsquor;Sender identifier' and &amp;rsquor;Acknowledgement Message Tracking #'. Processing of the acknowledgement is stopped, if duplicate message is found in the database and an error is logged into the log table.</p>
<p>The following table describes the error messages and reasons for the occurrence of corresponding errors.</p>
