Page[6]=new Array("As implemented in the CIS software, load-balancing is a process that:","Distributes the processing of synchronization connections among multiple computers, so that more data can be processed in a shorter period of time.","Provides fail-over capability by assigning the synchronization processing to another computer if one or more computers fail.","Note: Each synchronization is processed by only one computer at a time. Therefore, load balancing improves the performance of multiple synchronizations, not the performance of a single synchronization. ","If the CIS components are installed on a single server, the CIS software performs all load-balancing actions but distributes data only to the single server.","Note: Load-balancing manages synchronization loads only. The CIS Administration user interface should be accessed through a single application server, and should not be load-balanced. If CIS Administration is behind address translators, users should always be forwarded to a single application server.","Load-balancing configurations","208156.htm");
Page[7]=new Array("To set up a CIS load-balancing configuration, install the CIS software on multiple computers, using the same CIS database credentials for each installation.
