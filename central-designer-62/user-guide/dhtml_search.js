Examples of items that you might include in the data set include Initials and Date of Birth.","When a data series contains an item on a single form, and the item is not part of a repeating form or a repeating section, the data series is treated as an alias for the item itself and can be accessed as if it were a single global variable. ","A data set for ongoing, per-visit information.","In this data set, include items with values that change for the subject from study event to study event.
