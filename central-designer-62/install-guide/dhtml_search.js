","Two-tier","The application server and database server run on the same machine, and the client applications run on another machine.","Three-tier","The database server, application server, and client applications each run on a separate machine.

Page[3]=new Array("You can expand the performance capabilities of the Central Designer application server by adding multiple servers in a farm configuration. This configuration is called a web farm. A web farm setup distributes requests from the client applications among multiple application servers. A web farm is useful for the following reasons:","A large number of requests that might impact performance can be spread out among multiple application servers, thus improving performance. ","Multiple application servers allow for redundancy and failover protection.","In a web farm configuration, all application servers can process any request. However, certain operations are run asynchronously using the Central Designer Job Scheduler. The Job Scheduler is installed on every application server, but only one Job Scheduler can process jobs, and only one service is enabled to process requests. The Job Scheduler service that processes all requests is called the primary Job Scheduler. You can change the primary Job Scheduler at any time. Oracle recommends setting the Job Scheduler on the most powerful machine in the web farm as the primary.","Note: You must use the same port number, which you specify during installation, for all application servers within a web farm. If one of the application servers uses a different port number, the Job Scheduler will not work if the machine is set to run the primary Job Scheduler. By default, the port number is 53000. ","Web farm capabilities","114489.htm");
Page[4]=new Array("The following tasks are performed in a web farm configuration:","The client applications send requests through a firewall to a load balancer. The load balancer distributes requests among application servers. ","The job scheduler services on all of the application servers run; however, only the primary job scheduler processes requests. The other job scheduler services do not accept any requests. Examples of tasks that require the job scheduler service include importing and validation.
