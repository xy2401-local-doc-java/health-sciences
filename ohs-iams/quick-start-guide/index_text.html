        <h1>Oracle Health Sciences Identity and Access Management Service (OHSIAMS) Quick Start Guide</h1>

        <h2>Initial account setup</h2>
			<h3>1. Get your account information</h3>
			<p><strong>Where can I get the product or study URL?</strong> You will have access to one of these two pages, depending on what your organization opted to use. From there, you can open the applications or studies to which you have access.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>My Oracle Bookmarks</li><br>
				<li>Oracle Health Sciences Cloud landing page</li>
			</ol>
			<p><strong>How do I access my landing page?</strong> Your delegated administrator must first create your account in OHSIAMS Oracle Identity Self Service. After your account is created, you receive two emails:</p>
			<ol>			
				<li>New Account Email: Contains the user login for your Oracle Health Sciences SSO account.</li><br>
				<li>Account Password Email: Contains the password for your Oracle Health Sciences SSO account. Use this password only the first time you sign into your SSO account. After that, you must create a new password for your account by following the instructions <a href="#step5";>here</a>. The <strong>Oracle Health Sciences Cloud account</strong> link in this email takes you to one of the My Oracle Bookmarks or the Oracle Health Science Cloud landing page.</li>
			</ol>								
			<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Save these emails, so you can return to them when you are notified that you have been given access to Oracle applications managed through OHSIAMS Oracle Identity Self Service. If you lose these emails, contact your delegated administrator or <a href="http://www.oracle.com/us/support/contact/health-sciences-cloud-support/index.html" target="_blank">Health Sciences Support</a> to get your user login and password.</p><br>			

			<h3>2. Sign in for the first time</h3>
			<p>A delegated administrator will create your account, and then you will receive two emails, one with your user login and another with a password. Sign in to setup your account and define your own password.</p>			
			<ol>
				<li>Click the <strong>Oracle Health Sciences Cloud account</strong> link in the Account Password email you received.</li>
				<li>Sign in using the user login from the New Account email and the password from the Account Password email.</li>
				<li>Enter the old password you received in the Account Password email.</li>
				<li>Enter the new password and confirm the new password.</li>
				<li>Choose three of the available challenge questions from the drop-down, and enter answers for them.</li>
				<li>Click <strong>Submit</strong>. <br>Your password is changed, and the Sign In page opens.</li>
				<li>Sign in using your new password. Depending on your organization's setup, you will be redirected to one of the following:</li><br>
					<ul>
						<li>My Oracle Bookmarks; watch these <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/health-sciences/my-oracle-bookmarks/mob-videos.html" target="_blank">short training videos</a> to get started with My Oracle Bookmarks. <br>From here, you can access (or open) any study or application that you work in.</li><br>

		<h2>Request access to applications and studies</h2>

			<ol>
				<li>Sign in with your user login and password.</li>
				<li>Enter a justification to request for authorization.</li>
				<li>Click <strong>Submit</strong>.<br>If valid, after a delegated administrator approves your request, the role that is required to access the study or application is assigned to your account.</li>     
			</ol>
			<p><strong>How do I know when I have the role?</strong> If you have the role, visiting the URL opens the application or study. If you don't have the role, you will see the access request form.</p>
			<p> <strong>Why is it taking so long for me to get access?</strong> Check with your delegated administrator on the status of your request.</p><br>
