<h2 class="sect1"><span class="secnum">10.1</span> Traditional and Enhanced DCI Books</h2>
<p>You can organize DCIs, which generally correspond to CRFs, into a casebook and assign them to visits (Clinical Planned Events, or CPEs) by creating a DCI Book. DCI Books are required if you are using Oracle Remote Data Capture (RDC) and can be used for Oracle Clinical data entry too.</p>
<p>Before you can define a DCI Book you must define Intervals and Clinical Planned Events (CPEs) as well as Questions, Question Groups, DCMs, and DCIs; see <a href="treatments.htm#BEIIICHG">Chapter 5, "Treatments and Schedules,"</a> <a href="questions.htm#BABCIAEC">Chapter 7, "Questions and Question Groups,"</a> and <a href="dcm.htm#BABEEHEI">Chapter 9, "DCMs and DCIs."</a></p>
<p>Oracle Clinical provides two types of DCI Books for use in different types of clinical trials:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="#CIHIBBJI">DCI Books</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="#CIHIGJIE">Enhanced DCI Books</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<a id="CIHIBBJI"></a>
<div id="OCCRS10102" class="sect2"><!-- infolevel="all" infotype="General" -->
<h3 class="sect2"><span class="secnum">10.1.1</span> DCI Books</h3>
<p>The traditional DCI Book is suitable for paper-based clinical trials for which you want to use the Oracle Clinical Page Tracking feature. This feature helps ensure that all paper CRFs are collected and their data entered. If your study uses the Page Tracking feature, you must use the original DCI Book type. See <a href="#CIHHAJHF">"Defining a Traditional DCI Book"</a> and <a href="#CIHHJAHH">"Using CRF Page Tracking"</a> for more information.</p>
</div>
<!-- class="sect2" -->

<div id="OCCRS10103" class="sect2"><!-- infolevel="all" infotype="General" -->
<h3 class="sect2"><span class="secnum">10.1.2</span> Enhanced DCI Books</h3>
<p>Enhanced DCI Books offer:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="#CIHJCGHG">Support for Flexible Studies</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="#CIHFIHHA">Additional Features</a> You can use enhanced DCI Books to take advantage of these features even if your study does not have a flexible design, as long as you do not use Page Tracking.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Page Tracking is not supported in Enhanced DCI Books.</p>
<a id="CIHJCGHG"></a>
<div id="OCCRS10104" class="sect3">
<h4 class="sect3"><span class="secnum">10.1.2.1</span> Support for Flexible Studies</h4>
<p>The enhanced DCI Book is suitable for flexible trial designs such as studies with multiple treatment arms and cohorts (groups of patients) with different assessments. In these trials, patients receive different assessments based on data collected during the trial. For example, a flexible study design for an oncological indication might require different disease states to have different schedules and assessments, with patients with more rapidly progressing disease being evaluated and dosed more frequently and patients with less rapidly progressing disease states being evaluated less frequently.</p>
<p>Open-ended cycling trials are also supported. You must define an adequate number of CPEs and Intervals and add them to the Enhanced DCI Book. You can add more during the course of the trial if necessary.</p>
<p>When you use an Enhanced DCI Book, the following flexible study features are supported:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Data-Triggered Rules</span>: You specify data points that determine which CRFs, CPEs, and Intervals are required, or <span class="italic">expected</span>, for each patient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Data Expectedness Calculation for Each Patient</span>: As soon as data is saved for a patient at one of these predefined points (or the system completes a batch job that may impact data expectedness for a patient), the system recalculates which CRFs and Intervals are expected for the patient, based on the defined rules.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Display of CRFs in RDC Onsite</span>: For each patient, the Casebooks page displays only the CRFs that are expected, and as the user enters data and clicks Next, the next CRF expected during the CPE for that particular patient opens. Any CRFs that have been entered but are no longer expected are still displayed.</p>
<div class="infobox-note">
<p class="notep1">Note:</p>
In other manual Oracle Clinical and RDC data entry interfaces all CRFs included in the DCI Book are available for data entry, not just those expected for the patient.</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Validation</span>: You can define an Enhanced DCI Book in any order and then run a validation utility that checks rule definitions against DCI, CPE, and Interval definitions and identifies any invalid conditions so that you can fix them; see<a href="#CIHDIJAI">"Validating an Enhanced DCI Book"</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<!-- class="sect3" -->
<a id="CIHFIHHA"></a>
<div id="OCCRS10105" class="sect3">
<h4 class="sect3"><span class="secnum">10.1.2.2</span> Additional Features</h4>
<p>Enhanced DCI Books include other features that are helpful whether your study is defined as flexible or not:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Navigation</span>: You can create, maintain and view the DCI Book pages for a selected CPE without navigating through all the pages for the book; see <a href="#CIHHGCAG">"Navigator: Building an Enhanced DCI Book"</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Copying</span>: You can copy all the DCI Book pages for a single CPE and insert them into another CPE.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Deleting pages</span>: You can delete all the DCI Book pages for a single CPE at once.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Renumbering pages</span>: You can run a utility to automatically renumber any range of Start Page numbers in CPE and DCI order, using prefixes and/or suffixes you specify. You can insert or delete a DCI in the middle of the study, or assign DCIs to CPEs in any order, and then run the utility to fix the Start Page numbers.; see <a href="#CIHJFGFF">"Numbering and Renumbering Pages"</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Validation</span>: The validation utility checks Start Page numbers and gives a warning if they are nonsequential. You can choose to continue with nonsequential page numbers or you can use the renumbering utility.</p>
</li>

<p>Oracle recommends defining a single DCI Book in flexible studies; see <a href="plan.htm#CHDBEEGE">"Using a Single DCI Book"</a>.</p>
<p>To open the Enhanced DCI Book window, select <span class="bold">Definition</span>, then <span class="bold">DCIs</span>, and then <span class="bold">Enhanced DCI Books</span>.</p>
<p>The Maintain Enhanced DCI Books window includes the following <span class="bold">Special</span> menu items:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Copy DCI Book</span>: You can copy only Active DCI Books. The system creates the new Book with a status of Provisional. All rules, Intervals, CPEs, and DCI Book pages are included in the copy, and the new book has the name COPYOF <span class="italic">original_Book's_name</span>. You must change the name before you save the new Book. The new Book is in the same study as the original Book; you cannot copy a Book from one study to another.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Validate DCI Book</span>; see <a href="#CIHDIJAI">"Validating an Enhanced DCI Book"</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">View Validation Results</span>; see <a href="#CIHCDCCB">"Viewing Validation Warnings and Errors"</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Calc Expectedness in Test</span>; see <a href="#CIHBIEJH">"When and How to Run Expectedness Calculation Manually"</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Calc Expectedness in Prod</span>; see <a href="#CIHBIEJH">"When and How to Run Expectedness Calculation Manually"</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Re-sequence DCI Book</span> reorders display numbers that are not in ascending CPE CPE Number order or have gaps. This option is available only when display numbers are out of sequence. This happens only in rare circumstances (either the Book was not created in the Enhanced DCI Book window or CPE numbers were changed after the Book was created) but if it does, the Book becomes unusable; no data can be entered against it. In addition, RDC Onsite displays (Invalid) after the book name in the Casebook column and does not include the book in the Assigned Book list of values in Patient Search.</p>
<p>If the Book's display numbers are not sequential, you receive a warning when you try to open your DCI Book in the <span class="bold">Navigator</span> window. You cannot make any changes to the book until you run the <span class="bold">Re-sequence DCI Book</span> job from the Special menu in the main Enhanced DCI Book window. The job does not affect Start Page numbers.</p>

<p>The DCI Book Navigator window provides summary information about every Clinical Planned Event (CPE) defined for the study, so that you can track your DCI Book definition progress. To reach it, click the Navigator button in the main Enhanced DCI Books window.</p>
<p>Use the <span class="bold">Navigator</span> window to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Check for Intervals and CPEs with no DCIs assigned yet</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select a CPE to display its individual pages (DCIs) in the DCI Book Page Details window</p>

<p>You can work in any order. For example, you can define DCI Book Pages for the Termination CPE before the Screening CPE. In a flexible study, you can define DCI Book Pages before you define rules, or you can define rules first, or alternate between the two tasks. You can run the validation utility (available from the Special menu of the Maintain Enhanced DCI Books window) or the renumbering utility for a Provisional Book at any time.</p>
<p>You can make changes only if the Book's status is Provisional.</p>
<div class="infobox-note">
<p class="notep1">Note:</p>
All CPEs are always displayed in Navigator window. However, if none of the CPEs in an Interval have any DCIs defined, the system treats the Interval as if it does not exist; validation fails if such an Interval is the target of a rule.</div>

<p>To make it possible to collect a DCI, or Book Page, at a CPE, you must do one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Assign the DCI to a CPE by adding it here.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If the DCI is not the target of a rule, it is <span class="italic">unconditional</span> and expected for all patients for whom the Interval in which the DCI is collected is expected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the DCI is the target of a rule, it is <span class="italic">conditional</span> and expected for a patient only when his or her data fulfill the condition of the rule.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make the DCI available as needed on an <span class="italic">unplanned</span> basis in the DCI Constraints window; this approach may be appropriate for adverse events and concomitant medications, for example. See <a href="#CIHFJHAJ">"Defining DCI Book Constraints"</a>.</p>

<p>You can view, insert, and delete DCIs in a CPE. DCIs should appear in the order in which they should be collected. Add them in this order or change their Display Numbers to change their order within the CPE. DCIs that are the target of a rule must come after the trigger DCI.</p>
<p>You can make changes only if the DCI Book's status is Provisional. You can insert DCIs even if there is already production data entered against the Book. If the insertion and renumbering of pages will change the page number of a page against which data has already been entered, you receive a warning. The page number displayed for the collected data changes.</p>

<p>To copy Book pages:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In the <span class="bold">DCI Book Navigator</span> window, select the CPE whose pages you want to copy and select <span class="bold">Copy Book Pages</span> for CPE from the <span class="bold">Special</span> menu. A pop-up appears.</p>

<li>
<p>From the <span class="bold">Target CPE</span> drop-down, select the CPE into which you want to paste the pages. The name of the Interval that contains the target CPE is displayed in the <span class="bold">Target Interval</span> field.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the <span class="bold">Page Number Seed</span> field, enter the seed you want to use, if any, for the pages in the target CPE. This seed, or lack thereof, overrides any existing seed used in the source CPE. If you want to use the same seed as in the source CPE, you must specify it. This is an optional field. See <a href="#CHDCEGGJ">"Page Number Seeds"</a>.</p>
<p>If you leave the Page Number Seed field empty, the system supplies whole numbers as page numbers, beginning with the number one (1) greater than the highest Start Page number without either a prefix or suffix already defined in the Book.</p>

<p>In Enhanced DCI Books you can enter DCI Book pages in any order and call a utility to renumber them at any time. The system calls the same utility when you copy CPE pages and paste them into a new CPE.</p>
<p>In addition, the system uses the utility to check Start Page numbers at the following times:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Book Validation</span>. When you run the Validate DCI Book job, the system calls the numbering utility to check if Start Page numbers are sequential and without gaps and returns a warning if they are not sequential. You can choose to have nonsequential Start Page numbers and gaps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Book Activation</span>. When you activate a Book, if the Book does not already have a validation status of Success, the system calls the validation job, which calls the numbering utility. The activation succeeds even if Start Page numbers are not sequential, but sets a validation status of Warning. If you want sequential numbers, you can set the status back to Provisional and run the numbering utility manually (select Renumber Book Pages from the Special menu in the DCI Book Navigator).</p>

<h5 class="sect4"><span class="secnum">10.2.6.1.1</span> Page Number Seeds</h5>
<p>DCI Book Start Page numbers can include a prefix and/or a suffix; that is, a character or string of characters before and/or after a number. The combination of the prefix (if any) and suffix (if any) and the number is called the <span class="italic">seed</span>.</p>
<p>By default, when you add a page to the Book the system uses the same seed as the previous page and increments the first number encountered when reading from left to right. If there is a number followed by a decimal point and another number (for example, 12.1), the system treats the decimal portion as a static suffix and does not increment it.</p>
<p>If you do not include a whole number in the seed, the system treats the letters you enter as a prefix and appends the number 1 to it, then increments by one for subsequent pages with same prefix. If you want a suffix or both a prefix and a suffix, you must include a whole number in the seed in the correct position.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">1</span> &mdash; There is no prefix or suffix. Next page by default: <span class="bold">2</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">A1</span> &mdash;"A" is the prefix and there is no suffix. Next page by default: <span class="bold">A2</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">A1.1</span> &mdash; "A" is the prefix and ".1" is the suffix. Next page by default: <span class="bold">A2.1</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">1.1A</span> &mdash; There is no prefix and ".1A" is the suffix. Next page by default: <span class="bold">2.1A</span>.</p>

When you generate the Patient Data Report in RDC, if any DCI/CRF does not fit on a single PDF page, the system automatically appends.<span class="italic">x</span> to the DCI's Start Page number.

<p>You can design your own numbering scheme within the restrictions of <a href="#CIHDFJAH">How Oracle Clinical Page Numbering Works</a>. Two possible number schemes are described below.</p>
<div id="OCCRS10142" class="sect4"><a id="sthref759"></a>
<h5 class="sect4"><span class="secnum">10.2.6.3.1</span> Sequential Integers</h5>
<p>If you use Start Page numbers that are only whole numbers, with no alphanumeric prefix or suffix, by default each DCI's Start Page number is the same as its Display number. Using simple sequential numbers can have drawbacks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you need to add a DCI in an ongoing study due to a protocol amendment, for example, you may not want the new pages to be inserted sequentially because page numbers associated with data already entered for subsequent pages will change. If you want to avoid this, use a suffix such as a, b, c for the newly inserted pages so that subsequent DCI Book pages keep the same numbers. You must insert these suffixes manually; the Renumber utility does not increment suffixes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you use a sequential integer number scheme in a flexible study, where all patients normally do not complete all the DCIs defined in the DCI Book, there will be gaps in each patient's page numbers; see next section.</p>
</li>

<h5 class="sect4"><span class="secnum">10.2.6.3.2</span> Interval and CPE Prefixes</h5>
<p>In a flexible study, when you know that all pages are not expected for any patient&mdash;for example in a study with multiple treatment arms such as the one shown in <a href="#CIHDDEAA">Figure 10-1</a>&mdash;you may prefer to use prefixes to give context to the page number.</p>

<br /></div>
<!-- class="figure" -->
<p>In the study design shown in <a href="#CIHDDEAA">Figure 10-1, "Multiple Paths"</a>, some patients will complete Intervals X and XX and other patients will complete Intervals Y and YY, but no patient will complete all those Intervals. If you use sequential integer page numbering and if in the study schedule Interval X is defined before Interval Y and Interval XX is defined before Interval YY, you would have pages numbers such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pages 1-50, Screening Interval</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pages 51-100, Interval X</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pages 101-130, Interval Y</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pages 131-146, Rest Interval</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pages 147-200, Interval XX</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pages 201-250, Interval YY</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pages 251-252, End of Study Interval</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pages 253-260, AE Log Interval</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Pages 101-130 and 201-250 would not be expected for patients who complete Intervals X and XX, and pages 51-100 and 147-200 would not be expected for patients who complete Intervals Y and YY. Therefore each patient's Patient Data Report would have big gaps in page numbers.</p>
<p>You may prefer to use page numbers that represent the Intervals and CPEs by adding character prefixes to the page numbers. Do not use numbers to represent the Interval or CPE name (or at least not in the prefix) because the system will increment the Interval or CPE number instead of the page number (it increments the first number in left-to-right order). You may want to name your CPEs in the study schedule with this in mind.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Give all CPEs a name that starts with an abbreviation of the Interval name&mdash;such as SC for Screening, X for Interval X, RST for Rest, END for End, and AE for AE Log&mdash;followed by an abbreviation for the CPE; for the purposes of this example say the first Visit in each Interval is A, the second one is B, and so on. (A meaningful abbreviation would be better in case you need to add a visit later.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use these abbreviations as the prefix in the Start Page seed, so for the first CPE in the Screening Interval the Start Page seed prefix would be SC_A. You must enter this Start Page prefix manually in Book Page Details once per CPE.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Give the first DCI in each CPE the number one. The system automatically increments the number for each successive DCI in the CPE.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The first DCI Start Pages for a patient following Treatment Arm X might then be SC_A1, SC_A2, SC_A3, SC_B1, SC_B2, SC_C1, SC_C2, SC_C3, X_A1, X_A2, X_A3, X_A4, X_A5, X_B1, X_B2, X_B3, X_C1, X_C2, X_C3, RST_A1, XX_A1....</p>

<li>
<p><a href="#CIHFBGBA">Defining an Interval Rule Trigger</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="#CHDDCCEC">Defining an Interval Rule Target</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Interval rules can be of two types, or actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Enable</span> rules make the target Interval (or Intervals), all the CPEs within the Interval, and all unconditional DCIs collected at those CPEs, expected for a patient if the patient's data meets the criteria defined in the trigger.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Bypass To</span> rules can have only one Interval as a target. If a patient's data meets the criteria defined in the trigger, the target Interval becomes expected for the patient and all intervening Intervals, CPEs and DCIs are not expected.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>An Interval can be the target of multiple rules. This is necessary, for example, when you want to bypass to the Interval in some cases but also use it for patients who do not trigger the bypass. See <a href="flex_examples.htm#CHDDAIFJ">"Defining Multiple Paths Through a Trial"</a> for an example of this; the End of Study Interval is the target of a <span class="bold">Bypass To</span> rule from the Screening Interval and it is also the target of an <span class="bold">Enable</span> rule from a DCI that is in the last CPE of both treatment paths.</p>
<p>The Book cannot be validated if there a duplicate rules. An Interval rule is considered a duplicate when the trigger DCI, trigger DCM (Qualifying Value), trigger Question (including null), target action and target Interval all have the same value as in another rule. The trigger Question values and "CPE(s) at which Trigger DCI is Defined" are not evaluated.</p>
<p>Bypass To Interval rules take precedence over all other types of rules if there is a conflict.</p>
<p>You are not required to define Interval rules in a flexible study. If you have no Interval rules defined in the DCI Book, all Intervals are expected for all patients who are assigned to that Book. Some DCIs in CPEs in the Interval may be conditional if you define DCI rules.</p>
<p>You can define rules only for studies defined as flexible in Clinical Study States (under Conduct, then Security).</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><a href="#CIHHCJAF">Defining a DCI Rule Target</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>By defining a DCI rule, you make one or more DCIs conditional, so that they are expected for a patient only if the patient's own data meets the criteria specified in the rule trigger. You are not required to define DCI rules in a flexible study. If you have no DCI rules, all DCIs are expected for all patients assigned to the Book, although entire Intervals may be conditional if you define Interval rules.</p>
<p>To define rules for a DCI Book, the current study must be defined as flexible in Clinical Study States (under Conduct, then Security).</p>
<p>You can define rules either before or after defining related DCI Book Pages.</p>
<div class="infobox-note">
<p class="notep1">Tip:</p>
To see all the rule fields at the same time, expand the window by dragging the edge to the right. This does not work the first time you open the window during your session, but if you close the window and reopen it you can then expand it.</div>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Immediately after a user assigns or reassigns patients to a DCI Book using the user interface</p>

<h4 class="sect3"><span class="secnum">10.3.2.1</span> When to Run Expectedness Calculation Manually</h4>
<p>Because the system runs expectedness calculation automatically each time patient data is updated and after patient book assignment changes, there are very few situations in which you need to explicitly calculate expectedness. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>After activating an enhanced DCI Book that has patients assigned</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After "unfreezing" patients whose assigned book was activated while they were frozen</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After making an existing study flexible in the Clinical Study States window: you must then set any active books to Provisional and reactivate them, and then run Calc Expectedness in Test for all patients and all books. (If a nonflexible study has production data you cannot make the study flexible.)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, if there is a system failure during a batch data load or batch data delete, expectedness calculation may not have completed. You may want to run the job manually. If you do not run the job manually, and if the book is valid, the system will run the job automatically for each patient during the next data entry transaction for the patient or the next batch validation.</p>
<div class="infobox-note">

<p>You use a <a id="sthref770"></a>DCI Book to<a id="sthref771"></a> sequence the order of DCIs and their default keys during the data entry login process. This sequencing simplifies the process of entering CRFs, which are themselves sequenced in a predefined order. Most companies enter CRF information from a clinical record book organized in CPE <a id="sthref772"></a>sequence. You can use Oracle Clinical's DCI Book feature to create the electronic equivalent, with the DCIs, which correspond to the CRF pages, ordered as the information in the clinical record book appears. In this way, a DCI Book is like an index to the clinical record book. (When you add a DCI to the DCI Book Pages, the system automatically adds it to the DCI Book Constraints and marks it as "Planned in Book." You can specify DCI version usage for a book, and set a policy for which DCIs can or cannot be used for unplanned events. See <a href="#CIHHAJHF">"Defining a Traditional DCI Book"</a>. See also <a href="#CIHHJAHH">"Using CRF Page Tracking"</a>, for instructions on enabling DCI Book page tracking.)</p>
<p>A study can have many<a id="sthref773"></a> DCI Books for different purposes, or just one for the whole study. You give each DCI Book a unique name. A login entry operator chooses the DCI Book appropriate for a CPE's CRFs.</p>
<p>You can define the pages of the <a id="ABC1122885"></a>DCI Book by selecting the <span class="bold">DCI Book Pages</span> button to invoke the DCI Book Pages window.</p>

<h2 class="sect1"><span class="secnum">10.7</span> Using CRF Page Tracking</h2>
<p>Oracle Clinical provides the capability to track each page of a paper CRF online. This capability has three primary benefits. First, it allows you to identify when only a page or two from a document is missing (rather than the entire CRF). The missing page can then either be located or explicitly identified on line as missing. Second, it allows discrepancies to be identified as being on a particular page. This would be helpful if you were discussing a discrepancy with someone by phone. Third, if you are scanning CRFs into the system, the concept of pages (versus documents) becomes very important. Scanners enter documents a page at a time, so it is the concept of a page that is central.</p>
<p>Using this feature requires enabling options at the following Oracle Clinical levels, then the tasks required at each level are described in detail in separate sections:</p>

<p><a id="OCCRS10198"></a><span class="subhead3">Default Page Numbering Scheme&nbsp;</span>establishes the default page numbering scheme that Oracle Clinical will use for the pages of an expected DCI&mdash;a DCI that is specified in the default DCI Book for the specific CPE. This numbering scheme describes how each page of the CRF will be designated in the DCI. This field has a list of values with the following entries:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">SEQUENTIAL</span> &ndash; Designate each page by a sequential integer, for example, 1, 2, 3.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">ALPHANUMERIC</span> &ndash; Designate each page by an integer plus an alphabetic suffix; for example, 1a, 1b, 1c.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">NUMERIC</span> &ndash; Designate each page by an integer plus a numeric suffix; for example, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3.</p>

A DCI is regarded as expected if it is in a DCI Book, has a clinical planned event assigned and an actual event number of zero. Anything else is regarded as unexpected. This numbering scheme describes how each page of the CRF will be designated in the DCI. This field has a list of values with the following entries: <code dir="ltr">SEQUENTIAL</code>, <code dir="ltr">ALPHANUMERIC</code>, <code dir="ltr">NUMERIC</code>.</p>
<p>It is possible to assign an event to a DCM within an unplanned DCI. In this case, the system uses the unplanned scheme for recording pages for that RDCM.</p>
<p><a id="OCCRS10200"></a><span class="subhead3"><span class="bolditalic">Expected No. of Pages</span>&nbsp;</span>establishes how many physical pages will be in the DCI. This number cannot be changed once production data has been collected with the DCI.</p>
<p>Oracle Clinical does not require you to invoke page tracking for every DCI used in a study with page tracking enabled. You can disable page tracking for an individual DCI. To access the Data Collection Instruments form, from the <span class="bold">Definition</span> menu, select <span class="bold">DCIs</span>, then choose <span class="bold">DCIs</span>.</p>
<p>If your DCI consists of one DCM and is complete on a single page or multiple DCMs all complete on one page, then no further definition is required for CRF page tracking.

<h3 class="sect2"><span class="secnum">10.7.4</span> Defining DCI Books to Track CRF Pages</h3>
<p>The DCI Book is the vehicle for applying the page tracking features of Oracle Clinical to data entry. Once you establish the page tracking criteria for each DCI, group them in study-specific DCI Books. Each study has a default DCI Book. Each patient is also linked to a DCI Book. If you do not explicitly assign a patient to a DCI Book, Oracle Clinical assigns that patient to the default DCI Book for the study. You can change to a different DCI Book in data entry. <a href="#CIHHAJHF">"Defining a Traditional DCI Book"</a> further describes defining DCI Books without page tracking.</p>

<h4 class="sect3"><span class="secnum">10.7.4.1</span> Creating the DCI Book</h4>
<p>DCI Books are flexible and allow you to truly match your physical CRF book to your online DCIs. As with the DCI definition, you must complete a series of drill-down forms to describe the configuration of the DCI Book to Oracle Clinical. Begin with the Maintain DCI Book form.</p>
<p>To create a DCI Book definition:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>From the <span class="bold">Definition</span> menu, select <span class="bold">DCIs</span>, then choose <span class="bold">DCI Books</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Complete the fields:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Status</span> &ndash; Database status for the DCI Book; controls the usage and attributes. Choices are P for Provisional, A for Active, or R for Retired. P is the default value for a newly created DCI Book. Since DCI Books are now definitional elements&mdash;accurate page tracking is dependent on them&mdash;you cannot delete them once you use them to enter production data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Status Comment</span> &ndash; Optional field allowing you to comment on changes made to the <span class="bold">Status</span> field.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Retirement Reason</span> &ndash; Optional field allowing you to comment if you retire a DCI Book.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Save. To exit the form without specifying CRF page tracking information, select <span class="bold">Exit</span>.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h4 class="sect3"><span class="secnum">10.7.4.2</span> Defining DCI Book Pages</h4>
<p>If you plan to utilize CRF page tracking, you must now provide additional information about each DCI Book page. Use the following field descriptions to understand how the entry in each field relates to CRF page tracking:</p>
<div class="inftblinformal">
<table class="cellalignment36" title="Fields in the CRF page tracking window" summary="Field descriptions and relationship to CRF page tracking: Display, Start Page #, DCI Names, Clinical Planned Event." dir="ltr">
<thead>
<tr class="cellalignment27">
<th class="cellalignment37" id="r1c1-t27">Field</th>
<th class="cellalignment37" id="r1c2-t27">Relationship to CRF page tracking</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="cellalignment27">
<td class="cellalignment33" id="r2c1-t27" headers="r1c1-t27">Display #</td>
<td class="cellalignment33" headers="r2c1-t27 r1c2-t27">Number that represents the DCI's place in the sequence of the DCI Book. The list does not have to be sequential; you can rearrange it so that DCI #4 precedes #2.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="cellalignment27">
<td class="cellalignment33" id="r3c1-t27" headers="r1c1-t27">Start Page #</td>
<td class="cellalignment33" headers="r3c1-t27 r1c2-t27">Page number assigned to the first page of the physical CRF. Since this number matches the actual number on the physical CRF, the format of this number can be different for each DCI in the book. It is also editable. The only restriction is that there cannot be two identical entries within the column.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="cellalignment27">
<td class="cellalignment33" id="r4c1-t27" headers="r1c1-t27">DCI Name</td>
<td class="cellalignment33" headers="r4c1-t27 r1c2-t27">Name of the DCI.</td>

<!-- class="inftblinformal" -->
<p>To define DCI Book pages:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In the DCI Book form, place the cursor in the row of the DCI Book you need to expand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click the <span class="bold">DCI Book Pages</span> button.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a row to this form for each DCI that should be part of this book. Use the field descriptions above and field help to complete each field.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It is important to understand the relationship between the <span class="bold">Display #</span> and the <span class="bold">Start Page #</span> fields. The display number describes the relative position of the DCI within the book. It is always an integer, but integers in this column do not have to be sequential. The Start Page Number is specific to the DCI. It describes the actual first page of the physical CRF, and each entry in this column can be based on a unique page numbering format.</p>
<p>When you enter a new DCI, if you are using a sequential, numeric, alphanumeric, or user-defined format, Oracle Clinical also calculates how many pages were in the previous DCI and generates an entry in the <span class="bold">Start #</span> field. You can change this entry, but you can only use the numbering scheme defined for that DCI; if the Start Page Number is in a different format from the DCI's numbering scheme, the system gives a warning message.</p>
<div class="infobox-note">
<p class="notep1">Note:</p>
Do not use identical characters twice within the column. For example, do not define two DCIs that start on page 2a. This can result in missing pages in the patient data and blank casebook reports.</div>
<p>For each DCI you add to this form, complete the steps in the next section.</p>

<h4 class="sect3"><span class="secnum">10.7.4.3</span> Describing Each DCI Page</h4>
<p>For each DCI described using the previous section, Oracle Clinical provides a DCI Book Physical Pages form. The previous form describes the overall parameters of each DCI within the book&mdash;how many pages and the page number of the first page. This form follows up with specific details about each physical page in the DCI. The information in this form is system generated, but you can overwrite fields, as required.</p>
<p>The fields on this form are:</p>
<div class="inftblinformal">
