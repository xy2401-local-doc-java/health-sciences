Page[2]=new Array("IRT is a randomization and trial supply management application that extends the operational capabilities of traditional interactive voice response/interactive web response (IVR/IWR) technologies and gives sponsors better management of complex trial designs and global supply chains.","Key benefits for clinical supply operations","Reduced need for change orders, since you can edit subject and supply parameters at any time.","Approval system, which:","Gives the sponsor control over study data and subject management while reducing costs and time for change orders.","Increases communication between sites and sponsors.","Increased accuracy in subject records through the ability to correct subject information (field by field or entire record).","On-demand access to trial information.","Lower event charges by leveraging the web vs. phone.","Access to multiple protocols with a single sign-on.","Support for global multilingual studies.","(optional) Integration with Oracle Health Sciences InForm GTM for streamlined workflow.","Key benefits for clinical supply management","Ability to release drug supplies through the Web.","Improved ability to manage inventory and over labeling activities.","Ability to create, assign, and manage supply strategies through the Web.","Reduced excess drug overage and waste&#8212;optional integrated clinical supply forecasting module.","Limited stock-outs due to built-in system intelligence.","Key benefits for investigator site","Ability to screen, randomize, and dispense drugs through an interactive subject dashboard.","Simplified drug receipt and inventory management.","What is IRT?","170263.htm");
Page[3]=new Array("In IRT, job roles and permissions control access to the functions of the application, the tasks you can perform, and the type of subject and drug supply information you can access. As a result, the environment is secure and tailored to the tasks you commonly perform.","User","A person who uses IRT. A user must be assigned a role to perform tasks with IRT.","Roles","In a study, groups of people have responsibilities in common. These responsibilities define the user's role&#8212;for example, study coordinator, field monitor, principal investigator, or drug supply manager. IRT provides a standard list of common roles for a study, which can be supplemented with custom roles.","Permissions","In IRT, each role has specific permissions. A permission provides or restricts access to the features of the application. Because a page is designed around particular tasks, assigning a permission to a role determines whether a person who is assigned that role can perform those tasks. The tasks a person can perform in IRT should correspond to that role's job responsibilities for the study.","Users, roles, and permissions","169102.htm");
Page[4]=new Array("Authentication is your first step toward getting access to IRT.","Authentication is a required security process for confirming that a person is who he or she claims to be. In IRT, the authentication process takes place through email (for a web user) or through fax or email (phone user), and provides you with a user ID and password for accessing the application.","The authentication process includes these steps:","Your user information is uploaded into IRT.","Unless this task is part of your job responsibilities, you don't need to worry about this step. For more information, if you are responsible for this task, see Adding and managing users.","This step prompts IRT to send you the two emails. You need the information in both communications to become authenticated.","Sign the User Authentication Form (UAF).","Before authentication, you receive the UAF by email or fax.","This UAF form contains the User Authentication Code (UAC), Site ID, Depot ID, Study Code, and User ID, which you enter during the authentication process the first time you log in to the study. ","Note: Do not send the signed UAF to Oracle.","Authenticate your user account.","Before you authenticate your account, you receive an email message that contains the following information:","User ID","Default phone password","A link to reset the web password","This step sets up a new password for the user name provided to you.","For newly created users, the UAF includes the IRT user ID and study code. The first time the user logs in, IRT verifies that the UAC entered by the user matches the UAC that was sent for that user ID. ","For existing users who are logging in to a new protocol for the first time, IRT verifies that the user&#8217;s email ID matches the email ID that the UAF was sent to.","For instructions on using the phone, see Phone access.","Log in to IRT.","The authentication process","170259.htm");
