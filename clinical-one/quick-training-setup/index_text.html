        <h2>How do I provision users?</h2>
			<h3>Overview of users and their tasks</h3>
				<p>Someone at your organization can have one or more of these roles:</p>
				<p><strong>Delegated administrators</strong> work in <strong>OHSIAMS Oracle Identity Self Service</strong> and are responsible for:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Provisioning user accounts for training administrators and training managers.</li>
					<li>Sharing the URL for Clinical One with all Clinical One user managers, training administrators, and training managers.</li>
				</ul>
				<p><strong>Clinical One user managers</strong> work in <strong>Clinical One</strong> and are responsible for:
				<ul>
					<li>Assigning users the appropriate roles.</li>
				</ul>
				<p><strong>Training administrators</strong> work in <strong>Clinical One</strong> and are responsible for:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Creating training studies for supported Oracle Health Sciences products.</li>
					<li>Assigning each training study to one or more training managers.</li>
				</ul>
				<p><strong>Training managers</strong> work in <strong>Clinical One</strong> and are responsible for:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Assigning training to trainees (not applicable for training associated with a study in the User Management Tool), and sending reminders about incomplete training.</li>
					<li>Checking the training that a trainee has completed, including running reports for assigned and completed training.</li>
					<li>Reviewing the twice-daily training completion reports that are sent over email, for your assigned studies.</li>
				</ul>
				<p><strong>Trainees</strong> work in <strong>Health Sciences Learn</strong> to complete their training and are reponsible for:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Signing in to Health Sciences Learn and completing their assigned training. After a training manager assigns training to a trainee or sends a reminder, the trainee receives an email with a link to Health Sciences Learn.
					<p style="margin: 0 0 0 0;"><strong>Note</strong>: Trainees who don't have an Oracle account can create one for themselves by clicking the link in the email. They'll receive another email to verify their email address and then can take their assigned training.</li>
				</ul>
	
			<h3>How to get access to OHSIAMS Oracle Identity Self Service and Clinical One</h3>
			<p><strong>OHSIAMS Oracle Identity Self Service</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Who needs access?</strong> Delegated administrators.</li>
				<li><strong>How do I get the product URL?</strong> You'll receive a welcome letter over email with the product URL.</li>
				<li><strong>How do I get my user name and password?</strong> After Oracle creates your account in OHSIAMS Oracle Identity Self Service, you receive two emails, one with your user name and another with a temporary password and a link to reset your password.</li>
				<li><strong>What if I want to add or change delegated administrators?</strong> Contact Oracle Support.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Clinical One</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Who needs access?</strong> Clinical One user managers, training administrators, and training managers.</li>
				<li><strong>How do I get the product URL?</strong> The URL is sent to the delegated administrator, who is responsible for sharing it with all Clinical One users.</li>
				<li><strong>How do I get my user name and password?</strong> After the delegated administrator creates your account in OHSIAMS Oracle Identity Self Service, you receive two emails, one with your user name and another with a temporary password and a link to reset your password.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Make the roles available to Oracle (One-time only)</h3>
			<p><strong>Who does this?</strong> Your company's delegated administrator.</p>
			<p>Make <strong>ClinicalOne_Production</strong> and <strong>ClinicalOne_Production_AssignGlobalRoles</strong> available to Oracle so that they can be assigned to Health Sciences Support in case you need help.</p>
			<p><strong>Tip:</strong> If your organization is already using Clinical One to deploy studies, you probably already published both of these roles, and you don't have to publish them again.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Open OHSIAMS Oracle Identity Self Service.</li>
				<li>Under the <strong>Administration</strong> menu on the left, click <strong>Roles</strong>.</li>
				<li>
					In the Search section, for <strong>Display Name</strong>:<br>
					<ol type="a">
						<li>From the list, select <strong>Equals</strong>.</li>
						<li>In the field, type <strong>ClinicalOne_Production</strong>.</li>
					</ol>				
				</li>
				<li>Click <strong>Search</strong>.</li>
				<li>In the Search Results, click the link in the <strong>Display Name</strong> column to open the role page.</li>
				<li>In the row of controls at the top of the role page, click <strong>Publish Role to External Organization</strong>.</li>
				<li>Select the checkbox for the <strong>oracle</strong> organization.</li>
				<li>Click <strong>Submit</strong>. A confirmation message appears at the bottom of the dialog box.</li>
				<li>Repeat steps 3 to 8 for the <strong>ClinicalOne_Production_AssignGlobalRoles</strong> role (Display Name: <strong>AssignGlobalRoles</strong>).</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>Provision training administrators and training managers in OHSIAMS Oracle Identity Self Service</h3>
			<p><strong>Who does this?</strong> A delegated administrator.</p>
			<p>If you previously managed training using User Management Tool, the Clinical One user managers, training administrators, and training managers at your organization might have already been created for you in OHSIAMS Oracle Identity Self Service. All you have to do is assign them the appropriate roles!</p>
			<ol>				
				<li>Sign in to OHSIAMS Oracle Identity Self Service.</li>
				<li>Add any training administrators or managers who haven't yet been created.
					<p style="margin: 0 0 0 0;">For instructions on adding users, see <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/health-sciences/ohs-iams/admin-guide/toc.htm#IAMSA102" target="_blank">Create a user account</a> in the <em>Oracle Health Sciences Identity and Access Management Service Administrator Guide</em>.</p>
					<p style="margin: 0 0 0 0;"><strong>Note:</strong> Your organization might have additional Clinical One user managers, but only one person needs the <strong>AssignGlobalRoles</strong> role. The role should be assigned to the person who will sign in to Clinical One first. Then that person can create other users, including additional Clinical One user managers, from within Clinical One.</p>
				</li>
				<li>For training administrators (including yourself, if you are both a delegated administrator and a training administrator for your organization), assign the <strong>ClinicalOne_Production</strong> role. 
					<p style="margin: 0 0 0 0;"><strong>Reminder:</strong> If you are already using Clinical One to deploy studies, you've probably set up the <strong>AssignGlobalRoles</strong> and <strong>ClinicalOne_Production</strong> roles so that all role assignments must be approved. For details about how to approve the assignments, see <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/health-sciences/ohs-iams/admin-guide/toc.htm#IAMSA139" target="_blank">Activate approval for a role</a> in the <em>Oracle Health Sciences Identity and Access Management Service Administrator Guide</em>.</p>
				</li>
				<li>For training managers, assign the <strong>ClinicalOne_Production</strong> role.</li>
			</ol>
			
			<h3>Create users in Clinical One</h3>
			<p><strong>Who does this?</strong> A Clinical One user manager. Don't forget to create your own account!</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Sign in to Clinical One.</li>
				<li>On the Home page, click <strong>Global Settings</strong>, along the top.</li>
				<li>Click <strong>Create Global User</strong>.</li>
				<li>From the <strong>Full Name</strong> drop-down, select the user's name.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong>Global Roles</strong> field, and select the appropriate role:
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Global User Manager</strong>: Assign this to Clinical One user managers at your organization, including yourself.</li>
						<li><strong>Training Administrator</strong>: Assign this role to all training administrators.</li>
						<li><strong>Training Managers</strong>: Assign this role to all training managers.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<p style="margin: 0 0 0 0;"><strong>Tips:</strong>
					<ul>
						<li>Users at your organization might have one, some, or all of these roles. And don't forget to assign these roles, as appropriate, to yourself.</li>
						<li>If someone has both the Training Administrator and Training Manager roles, they can see and manage all studies but receive the training completion report over email only for the studies they're assigned to.</li>
					</ul>
				<li>Click <strong>Create</strong>.</li>
				<li>Create additional users as needed.</li>
			</ol>
			
        <h2>What are my tasks as a training administrator?</h2>

			<h3>Create a training study</h3>
			<p><strong>If Oracle hosts your study:</strong> The only training studies you need to create are for assigning training that isn't associated with a study, such as training for the User Management Tool (UMT) or for a release you're considering upgrading to.
