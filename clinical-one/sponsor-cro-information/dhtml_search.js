","The next step depends on the location of the drug destruction facility:","If a site is drug destruction capable, the site user destroys the kits and changes the status of the kits to Destroyed according to the protocol and relevant SOPs. ","If a site can't destroy drugs on site, either the CRA or someone at the site sends the kits that are ready for destruction to a depot that is a drug destruction facility, where they are destroyed according to the protocol and relevant SOPs. The receiving depot can be either the depot that shipped the product to the site or a tertiary depot that provides destruction capabilities.
