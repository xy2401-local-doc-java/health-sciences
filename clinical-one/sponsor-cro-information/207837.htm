<p class="bodytext"><a id="h213784" class="prattblock" title="What if a site anticipates an enrollment surge?" href="javascript:toggleBlock('213784')" target="_self">What if a site anticipates an enrollment surge?</a></p>
<div id="d213784" class="expandingblock" style="display:none"><p class="bodytext">If a site is having a clinic day, the site does one of the following tasks:</p>
<ul class="listbullet"><li class="listbullet">Requests a manual shipment, if the study allows it.<p class="listcontinue">When you set up supply settings for the study, you choose whether sites can request manual shipments, and you define the contents of the shipments in the resupply strategy that you assign to each site. You can <a id="h211565" class="jumptemplate-noheadingtext" title="Add and remove kits in a shipment" href="209810.htm" target="_self">modify the contents of any pending shipment</a>.</p>
</li><li class="listbullet">Tells their CRA that they need additional supply. <p class="listcontinue">You choose the contents when you <a id="h211568" class="jumptemplate-noheadingtext" title="Create a manual shipment" href="207513.htm" target="_self">create the manual shipment</a>.</p>
</li></ul><p class="bodytext">A manual shipment does not affect the resupply shipments that sites receive automatically, though an increase in supply at a site from a manual shipment might mean that a new resupply shipment isn't created until the supply is dispensed. </p>
<p class="bodytext">If the enrollment surge changes the number of anticipated subjects for the site, you might need to change the resupply strategy for the site so that they have sufficient supply going forward. </p>
</div><p class="bodytext"><a id="h213787" class="prattblock" title="How often should I run inventory?" href="javascript:toggleBlock('213787')" target="_self">How often should I run inventory?</a></p>
<div id="d213787" class="expandingblock" style="display:none"><p class="bodytext">Consider the following factors:</p>
<ul class="listbullet"><li class="listbullet">Days that the depot ships.<p class="listcontinue">For instance, some organizations don't run inventory on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights because depots aren't able to ship those orders until Monday.</p>
</li><li class="listbullet">The risk associated with the planned frequency.<ul class="listbullet2"><li class="listbullet2">If you run inventory two times per week, shipments might not contain enough kits to accommodate high enrollment activity in a short period of time.<p class="listcontinue2">Additionally, a replacement shipment might be generated late. For example, if a shipment arrives at a site damaged, the site probably requires a replacement shipment immediately. However, the new shipment is created only after inventory runs again. If inventory doesn't run for a few days, the site might have inventory issues for planned visits that occur before the new shipment is delivered. </p>
<p class="listcontinue2">The risk is greater when a site's entire inventory is damaged or experiences a temperature excursion.</p>
</li><li class="listbullet2">If you run inventory daily, a depot might send a site many small shipments, which can be expensive and inefficient. </li></ul></li></ul></div><p class="bodytext"><a id="h213788" class="prattblock" title="What levels of the supply chain can I manage in Clinical One?" href="javascript:toggleBlock('213788')" target="_self">What levels of the supply chain can I manage in Clinical One?</a></p>
<div id="d213788" class="expandingblock" style="display:none"><p class="bodytext">You can manage shipments from depots to sites and manage inventory at each site.</p>
</div><p class="bodytext"><a id="h213789" class="prattblock" title="Which resupply strategy should I use?" href="javascript:toggleBlock('213789')" target="_self">Which resupply strategy should I use?</a></p>
<div id="d213789" class="expandingblock" style="display:none"><ul class="listbullet"><li class="listbullet">To resupply a site only when the site's inventory is low, use Min/Max Resupply.<p class="listcontinue">When Clinical One runs inventory, shipments are created as needed to bring the inventory at sites up to the maximum number of kits you specify.</p>
</li><li class="listbullet">To resupply a site based on actual enrollment and planned dispensation visits, use Predictive Resupply.<p class="listcontinue">After running inventory, Clinical One creates shipments to meet each site's inventory requirements for the coming weeks. You specify the number of weeks to consider and the number of weeks to order for.</p>
<p class="listcontinue">You also set minimum and maximum levels so that sites have sufficient supply for new subjects. </p>
</li></ul></div><p class="bodytext"><a id="h213791" class="prattblock" title="Do I need to monitor product levels at sites?" href="javascript:toggleBlock('213791')" target="_self">Do I need to monitor product levels at sites?</a></p>
<div id="d213791" class="expandingblock" style="display:none"><p class="bodytext">No, though you can <a id="h211562" class="jumptemplate-noheadingtext" title="Monitor site and depot stock levels" href="207481.htm" target="_self">check site and depot stock levels at any time</a>. Clinical One runs inventory to monitor product levels at sites, so as long as you <a id="h211917" class="jumptemplate-noheadingtext" title="Create a resupply strategy" href="211916.htm" target="_self">created resupply strategies</a> that meet sites' enrollment needs, you don't need to monitor product levels. </p>
<p class="bodytext">If you find that sites need frequent shipments, or if the shipments are taking longer than expected to arrive at sites, consider adjusting or switching their resupply strategy.</p>
