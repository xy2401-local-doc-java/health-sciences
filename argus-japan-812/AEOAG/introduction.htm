<p>As part of the PMDA E2B R3 implementation, the application is enhanced for the reporting related requirements.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Urgent Report flag</span>: You can schedule an Urgent report for a Product License based on the value of Case form &gt; Analysis Tab &gt; PMDA Information Tab &gt; General Tab &gt; Urgent Report Checkbox for that License.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Nullification Against changed Reporting Category</span>: Enables you to schedule both R2/R3 as Nullification report against a License for which Reporting Category was changed. The new <span class="bold">Justification</span> field is used as the Nullification reason.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="bold">Aware Date/Due Date of a downgrade/Nullification reports:</span> Schedules a Downgrade/Nullification report based on the Aware date and Due Date as per the latest case data rather than copying from previous report.</p>

<p>Argus J is able to generate and submit the following expedited paper report formats specified by PMDA (both E2B R2 and E2B R3) for drugs.</p>
<p>PMDA forms for Marketed Drugs:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Drug AE/Infection case report form 1</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drug AE/Infection case form 2 (5pages)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Surveillance report on drug, quasi drug, cosmetic case report form 3</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Surveillance report on drug, quasi drug, cosmetic case report form 4</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Surveillance report on measures taken for drug outside Japan such as production termination, recall, rejection, etc. form 5</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Surveillance report on measures taken for drug outside Japan such as production termination, recall, rejection, etc. form 6</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>PMDA forms for Investigational Drugs:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Investigational product AE/Infection case report form 1</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Investigational product AE/Infection case form 2</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Surveillance report on investigational product research report form 3</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Surveillance report on measures taken for investigational product outside Japan such as production termination, recall, rejection, etc. form 6</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides, for PMDA R2 Report&mdash;Paper Report generation logic for PMDA Marketed Form 1 and 2, and PMDA Investigation Form 1 and 2 are enhanced to be in synchronization with CIOMS and MedWatch reports for different type of users.</p>
<p>The Report Form List is used in the following sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Console J - Expedited Report Rules - <span class="bold">Form</span> section (irrespective of whether Japanese module is enabled or disabled)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Schedule New Expedited Report dialogue - <span class="bold">Form</span> section (only if Japanese module is enabled)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Medical Review - Preview of Expedited Report (only if Japanese module is enabled)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="subhead2"><a id="AEOAG159"></a>Report Handling</p>
<p>If an initial paper report (or a follow-up) was scheduled with Agency having the PMDA E2B R2 profile, and now the Agency configuration is updated to E2B R3 profile then the paper report respects the ongoing series and a new follow-up is generated in R3 paper format.</p>
<p>Note that, when submitting a follow-up report for a report submitted and received as an R2 Report, it is possible to switch to an R3 Report. However, submitting a follow-up report for a report submitted and received as an R3 Report, you will not be able to switch to an R2 Report.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Sending a FAX report (PMDA Paper Report Form) for immediate notifications</span></p>
<p>In case of a death in a case, it is now possible to generate and send a FAX report for immediate notification to PMDA.</p>
<p>In the PMDA E2B profile, the Argus Safety application distinguishes the PMDA reporting destination from other partner reporting destinations configured in Argus Console, based on the Agency Type and Agency Country fields configured in the Reporting Destination code list.</p>
<p>The E2B or Paper Report is scheduled for PMDA only when the When Agency Type is Regulatory Authority and Country is selected as Japan.</p>
<p>In the event of this not being the case, the application will not transmit the J.4b value in it and will also not perform the associated validation for the J.4b value.</p>
<p>The E2B Viewer &gt; PMDA Paper Report Forms view still displays the associated J.4b value for PMDA E2Bs as it is still based on an E2B report.</p>

<h4 class="sect3"><span class="secnum">4.1.2.2</span> Printed Paper Reports&mdash;Formatting Details</h4>
<p>The general guidelines while printing the data in the paper form:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Prints textual values instead of the coded values to aid human readability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the number of rows to be printed in a multi-record section does not fit a page, then the same section is continued to the next page along with the table header until all the records are printed completely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a non-repeatable field value exceeds the space available in the page, it is continued to the next page to print the overflowing value (like in MS word) until the full value is printed completely. All other fields are printed as per the format.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The separators are used as:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Comma ','&mdash;Multi byte</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bracket '(' and ')'&mdash;Multi byte</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Colon ':'&mdash;Multi Byte</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dash '-'&mdash;Single byte</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Null flavor printing is also supported in Paper Forms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>True/False is printed in all forms as Yes/No respectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A form starts only in a new page in the PDF irrespective of previous page data.</p>
<p>For example, if Form 2 Page 1 data is printed from page 3 of a report till page 4, then Form 3 Page 2 data is printed starting from page 5 and not from page 4 itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the "Include FAX Header on PMDA Paper Reports" checkbox under the Reporting Destination &gt; Agency Information tab is checked, then the Fax header is printed in the report as configured in the common profile switches for the respective PMDA paper report under Console &gt; System Configuration &gt; Argus J &gt; Reporting.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Text entered in Common Profile Switch is printed on the first page of the PMDA Paper Report.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fax header text is printed in MS Mincho with font size 16.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fax header text is printed in the line below the Report Format Number and is aligned to the left.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The page number is printed in the Footer (center aligned) for each page.</p>
<p>Format: &lt;Current Page Number&gt;/&lt;Total Number of pages&gt;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The report page number for each page (other than the main page 1, 3, and 5) is printed in the first table within the label <img width="126" height="18" src="img/printlabel.jpg" alt="label" />.</p>
<p>Format: Report page number&lt;space&gt;/&lt;space&gt;Total pages in that report</p>

<h3 class="sect2"><span class="secnum">4.1.4</span> Expedited Reports on DLP</h3>
<p>In addition to supporting revisions supported by local data entry and local locks, DLP has been enhanced to address existing gaps faced by customers while generating Expedited Reports in DLP.</p>
<p>A version in DLP is defined as case data that corresponds to an aware date when a significant data was received (initial receipt date or significant follow up dates).</p>
<p>A revision is defined as committed case data changes that spans from one version to the other and that always corresponds to a locked version.</p>
<p>When DLP is enabled for Expedited Report Generation:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Global Expedited Reports are generated based on the latest DLP case revision that corresponds to the aware date on which the report was scheduled. Global reports has been generated even if the case is in unlocked state if a case version exists for that aware date on which the report was scheduled. This is applicable to both Draft and Final reports.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a lock does not exist for the Aware Date on which the report was scheduled, the application picks up the next immediate DLP case revision for a later Aware Date for which a lock exists.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If no lock exists for any later aware date, see below.</p>
<p>Note that this is an outlier condition and the customer is expected to lock the revisions for which reporting obligation exists.</p>
<p>If no lock exists at all for any case revision, the report will not be generated, until the case is locked. Similarly, the Case Form will not display the Final report hyperlink or the Regenerate Report menu.</p>
<p>Further, the Batch Report Generation AG Service will not process the case. However, if the report is run as Draft, the report generates the draft, based on the latest case revision, even if no lock exists for any case revision.</p>
<p>Till this release, if more than one aware date existed in between case locks (global), the reporting scheduling algorithm determined the due date of the report based on the latest aware date, instead of the earlier aware dates in the same case processing cycle.</p>
<p>This has now been corrected so that the report scheduling algorithm determines the due date of a report against the earliest aware date (i.e., significant follow-up) in the case for the current case lock cycle.</p>
<p>Note that in this scenario, the reported data is based on the case revision corresponding to the later aware date. Also note that this scenario occurs mostly when the "Case Form Configuration | Auto Regulatory Scheduling" option is set to "Significant" or "Manual".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Local Expedited Reports are generated based on the latest DLP local case revision corresponding to which a local lock exists for Japan country for the Japanese aware date on which the report was scheduled (irrespective of current local lock state). This is applicable to both Draft and Final reports.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Note that the Japanese aware date is the J initial received or J significant follow-up dates if the USE_JPN_AWARE_DATE is enabled for the Reporting Destination. If the switch is not enabled, it is the global aware date. This is existing functionality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a local lock does not exist for the aware date on which the report was scheduled, the system shall pick up the next immediate DLP local case revision for a later aware date for which a local lock does exists. If no local lock exists at all for any case revision, the local report shall not be generated. However, if the report was run as Draft, the report shall generate the draft based on the latest case revision even if no lock exists for any case revision, or for any case revision for an aware date later to the aware date for which the report was scheduled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>J Expedited Reports always considers the J initial received and J significant follow-up dates as J aware date for determining due dates if the USE_JPN_AWARE_DATE is enabled for the Reporting Destination as with the existing functionality. If there is no Japan aware date or if the USE_JPN_AWARE_DATE is not set, the system defaults to the global aware date. This is applicable during follow-ups as well i.e., when there is no corresponding J follow-up date for a follow-up, the system takes the default global follow-up date.</p>

<h3 class="sect2"><span class="secnum">4.1.5</span> PMDA Device Reports</h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Two new Japanese expedited device report forms have been added to all expedited report listing sections in Argus Safety.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The following form options are displayed (in Japanese) to both English as well as Japanese users:</p>
<p>Report Form 8: Medical Device Malfunction/Infection Case Report (Form 8)</p>
<p>Report Form 10: Medical Device Research Report/Measure in foreign countries Report</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These form options are displayed to both Japanese as well as English users.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These form options are supported at all the following locations in Argus Safety:</p>
<p>Console J - Expedited Report Rules - Form Section (irrespective of whether Japanese module is enabled or disabled)</p>
<p>Console J - Code list / Batch report generation (irrespective of whether Japanese module is enabled or disabled)</p>
<p>Case Form - Toolbar - Draft (only if Japanese module is enabled)</p>
<p>Schedule New Expedited Report dialogue - "Form" dropdown (only if Japanese module is enabled)</p>
<p>Medical Review - Preview of Expedited Report (only if Japanese module is enabled)</p>
<p>Create Unscheduled report (only if Japanese module is enabled)</p>
<p>View Submitted report (irrespective of whether Japanese module is enabled or disabled)</p>
<p>Bulk Report by Form (irrespective of whether Japanese module is enabled or disabled)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These forms are not added to the Utility Blank Report Form User Interface as the Utility Blank Report Form feature has been deprecated from Argus Safety 7.0.1 release onwards.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>These report forms open up in Microsoft Word format (.doc) from all the places in Argus Safety application as specified (but not restricted to) in the above specified list using the following forms provided by PMDA retaining all its fields, dropdowns and macros. However, these WORD forms are not meant to be edited and updated back into Argus Safety application.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The message box which prompts to ask the user if the expedited report will print blinded data or not is not displayed for these Japan Device Report Forms as there is no blinded data printed in these reports.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During Bulk Transmit Email process, these WORD report forms will not be merged even if Reporting Destination - Report Transmission Options have been configured to do so.</p>
<div class="infobox-note">
<p class="notep1">Note:</p>
Merge feature is not required for these reports because the frequency of these Japan Device reports is quite low and there will hardly be any point of time when multiple WORD forms would exists in the system pending to be transmitted to a reporting destination.</div>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>These report forms are generated in Microsoft Word format (.doc) itself from both Draft and Final mode.</p>
<div class="infobox-note">
<p class="notep1">Note:</p>
These Japan Device Report Form 8 and 10 are not required to be supported on DLP case revision data as of now, because other PMDA Paper Reports and E2B are also not supported on DLP case revision data.</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>No mandatory field validation will be done during generation of these report forms, except for the following. All other validations are expected to be achieved by using Case Form Field Validations feature on the desired fields of the PMDA Device Information section.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If the value specified in Case form/Products tab/Device sub tab/PMDA Device Information section/Medical Device Reporting Category dropdown for the product for which the report is scheduled does not match with the allowed values for Form 8 or Form 10, then instead of opening the Report Form, application displays an error in the standard Argus Safety message box with OK button and the following message:</p>
<p>'Case does not have matching device reporting category for the selected device report form'</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The same error is logged as a report generation error, including if it occurs during background generation through Argus Safety Service. This error is also visible in the Report Details dialog - General tab at the bottom, as is displayed for the E2B generation errors.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regulatory Reporting Rules Algorithm:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Argus Safety Expedited Reporting Rules engine also considers "Device Reporting Category" dropdown value while matching rules against cases. It gets compared against the Case Form ' Products tab ' Device sub tab ' PMDA Device Information section ' Medical Device Reporting Category dropdown field value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Argus Safety Expedited Reporting Rules engine scheduled the due date for these Japanese Device reports based on the Japan Aware Date, as configured in Reporting Destination configuration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Argus Safety Expedited Reporting Rules engine schedules only one Japanese Device Report for each matching rule, for each suspect device product in a case, even if the case has multiple Japanese Device Licenses of the same License Type in the Event Assessment tab of the case. It also respects the Reporting Destination configuration for "Suppress Duplicate Reports", as configured.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If multiple matching product licenses of the same device license type exist for a suspect device product in the Event Assessment tab, the license with the earliest award date of the matching product is considered for scheduling the report.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the original product license for which the initial / previous follow-up report was scheduled is no longer available but another product license of the same product matching the same rule exists, then a follow-up report is scheduled in subsequent cycles instead of a downgrade.</p>
<p>Downgrade is scheduled only when no licenses for that product matching that rule exist in the case.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Draft report view: The following logic is followed for PMDA Device Report Forms 8 and 10 to identify the product license when these reports are opened up in draft view, where no product license and reporting destination is not specified:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Draft report view is applicable to the following areas:</p>
<p>Toolbar - Draft icon</p>
<p>Medical Review screen</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It uses the first matching suspect device product as per the sort order of products in the case form products tab which has the matching "Medical Device Reporting Category" specified in the "PMDA Device Information" section.</p>
<p>The following criteria is used to find matching Medical Device Reporting Category for the Japanese Device Form:</p>
<p><span class="bold">Allowed Device Reporting Categories for PMDA Device Form 8:</span></p>
<p>a. Malfunction without health damage</p>
<p>b. Malfunction with health damage</p>
<p>c. Infection</p>
<p><span class="bold">Allowed Device Reporting Categories for PMDA Device Form 10:</span></p>
<p>a. Research Report</p>
<p>b. Measures in Foreign Country Report</p>
<p>Earliest award date: Japanese marketed device active license (withdrawn date later than the Initial Receipt date) of such product is used.</p>
<p>If Japanese marketed device license is not available, the Japanese investigational device license matching the above specified criteria is used.</p>
<p>If no such Japanese device license is available for the matching product, then it considers matching any (irrespective of license country or license type) earliest award date active device license for the product.</p>
<p>In case of multiple device licenses with same award date, it uses the license with the earliest internal license id (primary key) value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If no product exists with the matching "Medical Device Reporting Category" for the Report Form, then instead of opening this form, the application displays an error in the standard Argus Safety message box with OK button and message - "Case does not have matching device reporting category for the selected device report form".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It uses the agency as specified in the Argus J common profile switch - "Default name of Regulatory Agency for Draft Expedited PMDA Reports" for such draft report views.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Manual Report Scheduling dialog for Argus J users is modified as specified below:</p>
<p>If the user selects "Downgrade Report" as a dropdown option in the dialog header, then the "Report Form" dropdown list is updated to only display E2B and PMDA Marketed and Investigational Forms 1 - 6. Other expedited report forms or PMDA Device Report Forms are not displayed for "Downgrade Report" option.</p>

<p>Separate page numbering always follow the previous form of PSR and ReSD. The following is the order of the page numbering sequence:</p>
<p>PSR Form 3, 4, 7, 7-2, ReSD Form 4, 5, and 789</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you select <span class="bold">PSR</span>, <span class="bold">ReSD</span> using the radio button, the system selects all the forms available for each set of report automatically (PSR - above table 1, 7, 10, and 13) (ReSD - above table 15, 20, 23, 25, 27, and 29). By default, PSR is selected and PSR forms are selected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the radio button is used to select the PSR form, the previously checked forms on the ReSD are unchecked. If the radio button is used to select the ReSD form, the previously checked forms on PSR are unchecked. While the PSR is selected, the <span class="bold">ReSD</span> section is disabled. While ReSD is selected, <span class="bold">PSR</span> section is disabled.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you close the configuration and opens again, the configuration on the UI remains as it was at the time of the last operation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All the forms format are based on the Novartis PSR form sample.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You are not allowed to change the configuration parameters for PSR Form 3, 4 and ReSD Form 4, 5; if there are any past (non-editable) timeframe rows. If there are past timeframe rows in the scheduling frequency table, configuration of the PSR Form 3, 4 and ReSD form 4, 5 is non-editable.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>This line listing is independently printed (using separate page) regardless of the <span class="bold">Configuration Printing</span> check box status.

<p>([3], [4]) US - YYYY, UK - YYYY, DE - YYYY</p>
<p>Where US, UK and DE are configured country codes in the profile switch in this particular order only.</p>
<p>Only Marketed Licenses related information are printed here. If Marketed License is not available then do not print any value for that country not even the A2 country code for that country.</p>
<p>The values are printed in the same order as A2 codes entered by user in the common profile switch.</p>

<p>Summary: J-DSUR - Form 2 is the report of events that are serious (both Reported and Not Reported) during the specified investigational time period for Study drugs (including Study for partial change of the Marketed drugs).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The past record is included in the report as cumulative Total Number of SOC and Terms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The number of the serious events which are either Reported or Not Reported to the PMDA within one investigational timeframe is the content for the report.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Regardless of <span class="bold">Incomplete</span> or <span class="bold">Complete</span> report, all the events during the investigational timeframe are listed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If there are multiple events in one case, count each Reportable event separately. For example, if there are 2 same PTs available in the same case, the count is 1 SOC and 2 PTs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A case is included in the report for the current timeframe only if a significant Japanese follow-up is received for the case in the same timeframe. If there are no significant updates for the case, this case is not counted for the current period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If there are multiple follow-up updates (Significant or Non-significant) to a qualifying case in the same investigational time frame, count the events based on latest information on the events in the case and exclude the <span class="bold">Deleted</span> events during the timeframe. If the event is entered as <span class="bold">Serious</span>, but later in the same timeframe, this is changed as <span class="bold">Non Serious</span>, this event is not counted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The MedDRA version is the latest MedDRA J version at the time of report creation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The configured products that fall in <span class="bold">DRUGCHARACTERIZATION = 1 (SUSPECTED)</span> or <span class="bold">3 (INTERACTION)</span> are collected. <span class="bold">2 (Concomitant)</span> is not included.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The date cut off for the data inclusion is based on the case's Japan first information Aware Date (in <span class="bold">PMDA</span> &gt; <span class="bold">General</span> tab of the Case Form). If this is a follow-up case, the Aware (latest significant follow-up) Date.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <span class="bold">Serious</span> events must be <span class="bold">Related</span> events to be included in the list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An event which is included in the past <span class="bold">J-DSUR</span> report is included in the <span class="bold">Cumulative Total</span> section of the count in the report.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For identifying the Japanese license, the license authorization country in the license configuration in Console is used. For the count of the foreign data, all configured products that have the same ingredients (regardless of the existence of Japanese license in this family) is considered as the target.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the End Date is set as past date, any updates/new data that meet above condition in between the End Date and the current date are not included in this line listings. The data is the latest in the given timeframe, and not between the investigational timeframe Start Date and the Report Generation Date. This is achieved when you have enabled DLP and has configured the <span class="bold">Use DLP Case Version</span> radio option for J-DSUR configuration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If there is 0 count on any counting numbering sections of the Line Listing, <span class="bold">-</span> is printed.</p>

<p>Seiyakukyo Line Listing report is a periodic report format specified by the JPMA. This report is to be used by pharmaceutical companies in Japan to send case reports to medical institutions. It is mandated by PMDA to report study cases to medical institutions and is required to be fully compliant in Japan.Seiyakukyo periodic report is handled in the similar manner as the other Japanese periodic reports - PSR/ReSD, and CSPSR. At a high level, it has a similar Configuration screen, similar Generation, Publishing, and Handling process as other Japanese Periodic reports. However, the report output format and data is different so as to match the Seiyakukyo format.</p>
<p>All the following date fields in the Seiyakukyo Line Listing main report output are printed in the "YYYY/MM/DD" format:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Dose Start Date and Dose Stop Date</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AE Onset Date</p>

<li>
<p>Subject Timeframe</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Report Submission Date</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Japan Information Receipt Date</p>
