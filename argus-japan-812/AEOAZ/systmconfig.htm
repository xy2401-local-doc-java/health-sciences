<p><span class="bold">PIP PMDA Profile Integration for No Reportable Events</span></p>
<p>The existing Argus Safety application checks for reportable events for PMDA E2B generation for transmission and import process. Due to this check, cases with un-encoded events or missing causality cannot be accepted successfully during follow up import process as reportable events scenario is not met for such follow ups. The Inform-Argus PIP profile has removed the check of reportable events from their profile SQLs. However, because of the 'No reportable' events check during E2B generation for follow up import, it is not possible to accept any follow-up report.</p>
<p>This scenario is encountered during Inform when other system sends un-encoded events to Argus.</p>
<p>This problem has been fixed only for custom PMDA profile. Argus Safety now has an option of excluding 'No Reportable' events check during PMDA E2B generation for transmission and import process based on a common profile switch 'PIP PMDA PROFILE'':</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Argus Safety now excludes the 'No Reportable' events check for a PMDA E2B report for custom PMDA profile configured in the 'PIP PMDA PROFILE' switch. This will allow a follow up report for a configured custom profile to be imported even though there are no reportable events in the case.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No Reportable events check is excluded for E2B generation both for transmission and import scenarios.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="bold">Device Report Responsible Officer</span></p>

<h4 class="sect3"><span class="secnum">2.2.1.1</span> PMDA Downgrade/nullification Report Scenario when All Events are Non-Reportable</h4>
<p>When reportable event is deleted from a Case Form by significant follow-up change, downgrade report against E2B to PMDA cannot be sent. Also, user is not able to send the nullification report when all the reportable events are deleted.</p>
<p>As per MHLW notification for investigational drugs, if reportable events disappears (becomes invalid events) by follow-up information and if there are no "reportable event" as result, it is necessary to report as nullification report. If reportable event(s) become non-reportable by follow-up information then a downgrade report is sent.</p>
<p>For Marketed drugs, when events in the case are updated in such a manner that none of the events in the case is valid then only nullification report is sent. If the reportable event becomes non-reportable by the follow-up information then a downgrade report shall be sent.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Definition of "Non-Reportable" and "Invalid" events:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Non-Reportable events - same as it exists today.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Invalid events are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Deleted events and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those events for which the "Not include for the report in Japan" (available in the Case Form | Japan Event tab) checkbox is checked</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The PMDA E2B follow-up Downgrade report is generated when all the valid events in the case became "non-reportable". A downgrade report shall:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Include all the latest valid events that exist in the case.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ignore non-coded events as it has already been implemented in the current functionality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not reference previously submitted report's data.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>For Marketed reports (reporting categories (1, 2, 3 and 4), In a scenario when events in the case are updated in such a manner that none of the events in the case remains valid (as described in the point # 1b above) then the PMDA E2B Nullification report is generated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For investigational reports (reporting categories (8, 9, 10, and 11), if all the reportable events w.r.t. previously submitted report becomes invalid (as described in the point # 1b above) by the follow-up information then the PMDA E2B Nullification report is generated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As per the existing implementation, the nullification E2B report will get its data (including the REACTION section) from the previous submitted E2B XML.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the nullification E2b reports is auto-scheduled for the above mentioned scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A new common profile switch "PMDA E2B Nullification Reason Text for No Valid Event Scenario" is created in console under Argus J &gt; Reporting with default value in Japanese - (There is no valid event available in the case). The profile switch is a text box having a maxlength of 200 characters. It support English as well as Japanese data entry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The value specified in the common profile switch "PMDA E2B Nullification Reason Text for No Valid Event Scenario" is used for the value of E2B element A.1.13.1 NULLIFICATIONREASON in PMDA E2B.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This enhancement is applicable for PMDA E2B Downgrade/nullification reports.</p>

<h2 class="sect1"><span class="secnum">2.4</span> Configuring Local Reports - Local Reporting Rule and Local Reports</h2>
<p>In order to control which reports need to be generated only after Local data entry is done, the application maintains a list of Report forms that are considered as Local Reports, by storing the following data fields:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Country - This is typically the country of license of the suspect product in a case for which there is a local reporting obligation. This could also be the local country expecting an active moiety reporting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reporting Destination - This is the reporting destination receiving the local report. This shall be populated based on user input during post upgrade script.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Report Forms - This is the local report. This is stored with the following reports for this release, as displayed in the image below:</p>
<img width="782" height="375" src="img/reportforms.jpg" alt="Surrounding text describes reportforms.jpg." /><br /></li>
</ul>
<p>A reporting rule that is for the Country + Reporting Destination + Report Form is the Local Reporting Rule.</p>
<p>Any reporting rule that is for the country + reporting destination + report form configured in the above table and in addition satisfies the Truly Local Case system criteria for the case from which these rules are triggered (i.e., the SQL or PL/SQL block or the database function configured in the 2.3.0 returns a value &gt; 0) is referred to as <span class="bold">Local reporting rules</span>.</p>
<p>Any report that is scheduled by a Local reporting rule is considered a Local report (note that this would have already satisfied the Truly Local case switch as described above).</p>
<p>For the purpose of this release, this configuration data is maintained via backend procedures and no maintenance facility needs to be provided via UI.</p>
<p>Note that to utilize the local locking feature, the customer is expected to maintain the proper <span class="bold">Reporting Destination</span> value in this table.</p>
<p>Expedited Reports generated as part of Periodic Reports are not considered local reports for this release.</p>
